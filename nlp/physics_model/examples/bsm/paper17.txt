Search for resonant double Higgs production with bbZZ decays in the bb̅ℓℓνν final state. A search for the resonant double Higgs boson production is performed using 2016 data collected with the CMS experiment at √(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Events in which one Higgs boson decays to a pair of b quarks, and the other Higgs boson to a pair of Z bosons are studied. Decays to electron and muon pairs are selected to reconstruct an on-shell Z boson, while the other Z boson is allowed to be off-shell and required to decay to neutrinos: X → HH → bb̅ZZ^*→ bb̅ℓℓνν. Limits are set on the resonant double Higgs boson production cross section for a resonance with a mass in the range from 250 to 1000 GeV for spin 0 and spin 2 hypotheses.
