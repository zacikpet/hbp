Search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons produced in association with b-quarks and decaying to b-quarks at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons produced in association with one or two b-quarks and decaying to b-quark pairs is presented using 27.8 fb^-1 of √(s)=13 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2015 and 2016. No evidence of a signal is found. Upper limits on the heavy neutral Higgs boson production cross-section times its branching ratio to bb̅ are set, ranging from 4.0 to 0.6 pb at 95% confidence level over a Higgs boson mass range of 450 to 1400 GeV. Results are interpreted within the two-Higgs-doublet model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
