Evidence for Higgs boson decays to a low-mass dilepton system and a photon in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Higgs boson decaying into a photon and a pair of electrons or muons with an invariant mass m_ℓℓ < 30 GeV is presented. The analysis is performed using 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data, produced by the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and collected by the ATLAS experiment. Evidence for the H→ℓℓγ process is found with a significance of 3.2σ over the background-only hypothesis, compared to an expected significance of 2.1σ. The best-fit value of the signal strength parameter, defined as the ratio of the observed signal yield to the one expected in the Standard Model, is μ = 1.5 ± 0.5. The Higgs boson production cross-section times the H →ℓℓγ branching ratio for m_ℓℓ < 30 GeV is determined to be 8.7 ^+2.8_-2.7 fb.
