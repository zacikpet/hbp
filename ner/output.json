[{"content": "Combined measurements of the mass and signal strength of the Higgs-like boson with the ATLAS detector using up to 25 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. An update is presented of the measurement of the properties of the newly discovered boson using the the full pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for the channels H\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ^(*)\u2192 4l, corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 4.8 fb^-1 at \u221a(s)=7TeV and 20.7 fb^-1 at \u221a(s)=8TeV. The combined mass measurement derived from the H\u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and H \u2192 ZZ^(*)\u2192 4l channels is m_H=125.5 \u00b1 0.2 (stat) ^+0.5_-0.6 (sys)GeV. The combination of all final states, including the H \u2192\u03c4^+\u03c4^- and H \u2192 bb\u0305 channels using data corresponding to integrated luminosity of about 4.8 fb^-1 at \u221a(s)=7TeV and 13 fb^-1 at \u221a(s)=8TeV and the H \u2192 WW^(*)\u2192 l\u03bd l\u03bd channel using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 13 fb^-1 at \u221a(s)=8TeV, is reported in terms of the combined signal strength (\u03bc) and production and decay mode specific signal strengths.

A search for the Higgsstrahlung process e+e- -> hZ is described, where the neutral Higgs boson h is assumed to decay into hadronic final states.

The analysis is based on e+e- collision data collected by the OPAL detector at energies between 192 GeV and 209 GeV. The search does not reveal any significant excess over the Standard Model background prediction. Results are combined with previous searches at energies around 91 GeV and at 189 GeV.
