Interpretations of the combined measurement of Higgs boson production and decay. First combined measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay using up to 139 fb^â1 of protonâproton collision data at âs = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment have recently been performed. This note presents two interpretations of these combined Higgs boson measurements. Measurements targeting Simplified Template Cross Sections in different decay channels are reparameterized in terms of the impact of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operators and constraints are reported on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. Measurements are furthermore interpreted in several MSSM benchmark scenarios, resulting in constraints on the MSSM parameters (m_A, tan Î²) that are complementary to those obtained from direct searches for additional Higgs bosons. For all interpretations, no significant deviations from the Standard Model are observed.
