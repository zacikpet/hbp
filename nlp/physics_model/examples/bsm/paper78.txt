Search for a Higgs boson decaying to four photons through light CP-odd scalar coupling using of 7 TeV pp collision data taken with ATLAS detector at the LHC. In some extensions of the Standard Model, such as MCHM or NMSSM, the Higgs boson can couple to light CP-odd scalar particles. This document presents a study of a possible contribution to a Higgs boson signal in the H→γγ channel due to H→ a a decays, where a is a light CP-odd scalar particle that decays predominantly into two photons before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter. Although this process yields four photon final states, we show that for a in the mass range of 100-400 MeV, the two photons from each a decay are often collimated so that they may be identified as a single photon. A large fraction of these events would contribute to an effective H→γγ signal. By following a selection similar to that of the H→γγ analysis, we set experimental limits for a generic class of Standard Model extensions having Higgs boson couplings to light scalar particles, assuming the a decays before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter.
