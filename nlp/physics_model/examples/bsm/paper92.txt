Search for electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in final states with a Higgs boson in pp collisions at 8 TeV. This note reports the results for searches for the direct electroweak production of supersymmetric charginos and neutralinos in final states with a Higgs boson. The data sample consists of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy âˆš(s)=8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb^-1. The signature consists of a chargino-neutralino pair decaying to a W boson, a Higgs boson, and missing transverse energy from escaping lightest supersymmetric particles. The data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds. The results are interpreted to probe charginos and neutralinos with masses up to 204 GeV.
