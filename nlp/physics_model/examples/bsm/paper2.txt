Search for the flavor-changing interactions of the top quark with the Higgs boson in H → bb̅ channel at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) in associated production of a top quark with a Higgs boson is presented. Two channels are considered: top quark pair production, with FCNC decay of the top quark or antiquark, and single top production (pp → tH). This is the first analysis to probe top-Higgs FCNC couplings in the single top production mode. A final state with one isolated lepton and at least three reconstructed jets, among which at least two are identified as b quark jets, is studied. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV in 2016. No significant deviation is observed from predicted background. Observed (expected) upper limits at 95
