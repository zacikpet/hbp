Combination of searches for invisible Higgs boson decays with the ATLAS experiment. Dark matter particles, if sufficiently light, may be produced in decays of the Higgs boson. This Letter presents a statistical combination of searches for H→invisible decays where H is produced according to the Standard Model via vector boson fusion, Z(ℓℓ)H, and W/Z(had)H, all performed with the ATLAS detector using 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 13 TeV at the LHC. In combination with the results at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, an exclusion limit on the H→invisible branching ratio of 0.26 (0.17^+0.07_-0.05) at 95% confidence level is observed (expected).
