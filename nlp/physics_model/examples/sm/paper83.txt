Measurement of differential fiducial cross sections for Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A measurement of the integrated and differential fiducial production cross sections for the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel at √(s)=13 TeV is performed using 35.9 fb^-1 of pp collisions data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Differential cross sections are measured as a function of the diphoton transverse momentum and jet multiplicity. All cross sections are measured within a fiducial phase space defined by the requirements on the photons kinematics, their isolation, and the event topology. The measured cross sections are compared to state of the art theoretical predictions for the Standard Model Higgs bosons. A good agreement between observations and predictions is observed.
