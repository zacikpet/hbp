Charged Higgs bosons are assumed to be pair-produced and to decay into qq, tnt or AWpm. No signal is observed. Model-independent limits on the charged Higgs-boson production cross section are derived by combining these results with previous searches at lower energies. Excluded areas on the [mHpm, BR(Hpm->TV)] plane are presented assuming BR(Hpm->tnt)+BR(Hpm->qq)=1. Under the above assumption, motivated by general 2HDM type II models, charged Higgs bosons are excluded up to a mass of 76.6GeV at 95% confidence level, independent of the branching ratio BR(Hpm->tnt).

"Higgs boson searches in CP-conserving and CP-violating MSSM scenarios with the DELPHI detector. This paper presents the final interpretation of the results from DELPHI on the searches for Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). A few representative scenarios are considered, that include CP conservation and explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector. The experimental results encompass the searches for neutral Higgs bosons at LEP1 and LEP2 in final states as expected in the MSSM, as well as LEP2 searches for charged Higgs bosons and for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into hadrons independent of the quark flavour. The data reveal no significant excess with respect to background expectations. The results are translated into excluded regions of the parameter space in the various scenarios. In the CP-conserving case, these lead to limits on the masses of the lightest scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons, h and A, and on tan(beta). The dependence of these limits on the top quark mass is discussed. Allowing for CP violation reduces the experimental sensitivity to Higgs bosons. It is shown that this effect depends strongly on the values of the parameters responsible for CP violation in the Higgs sector.

A search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar a bosons is performed in the final state with two muons and two taus. The motivation lies in models beyond the standard model, such as two-Higgs-doublet models extended with a complex singlet (2HDM+S). The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, accumulated by the CMS experiment at LHC in 2012 at 8 TeV center-of-mass energy. Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 20 and 62.5 GeV are probed, and upper limits between 4 and 15

"Search for new neutral Higgs bosons through the H→ Z A→ℓ^+ℓ^-bb̅ process in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. This paper reports on a search for an extended scalar sector of the standard model, where a new CP-even (odd) boson decays to a Z boson and a lighter CP-odd (even) boson, and the latter further decays to a b quark pair. The Z boson is reconstructed via its decays to electron or muon pairs. The analysed data were recorded in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within the uncertainties. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching fraction, with masses of the new bosons up to 1000 GeV. The results are interpreted in the context of the two-Higgs-doublet model.

"Search for resonant pair production of Higgs bosons in the bbZZ channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search for the production of a narrow-width resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons decaying into the bbZZ channel is presented. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector during 2016, in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The final states considered are the ones where one of the Z bosons decays into a pair of muons or electrons, and the other Z boson decays either to a pair of quarks or a pair of neutrinos. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the production of narrow-width spin-0 or spin-2 particles decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons, in models with and without an extended Higgs sector. For a resonance mass range between 260 and 1000 GeV, limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of a spin-0 and spin-2 resonance range from 0.1 to 5.0 pb and 0.1 to 3.6 pb, respectively. These results set limits in parameter space in bulk Randall-Sundrum radion, Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton, and N2HDM models. For specific choices of parameters the N2HDM can be excluded in a mass range between 360 and 620 GeV for a resonance decaying to two Higgs bosons. This is the first search for Higgs boson resonant pair production in the bbZZ channel.

"Search for a non-standard-model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of new light bosons in four-muon final states. Results are reported from a search for non-standard-model Higgs boson decays to pairs of new light bosons, each of which decays into the μ^+ μ^- final state. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.65 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012. One event is observed after analysis selection requirements were applied. A model-independent upper limit on the product of the cross section times branching fraction times acceptance is derived. The results are applicable to a broad spectrum of new physics scenarios and are also compared with the predictions of two benchmark models, NMSSM and dark SUSY, as functions of a Higgs boson mass larger than 86and of a new light boson mass within the range 0.25–3.55.

"Study of the Higgs boson decaying to WW^* produced in association with a weak boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The search for Higgs boson production in association with a W or a Z boson, in the decay channel H → WW^*, is performed with a data sample collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies √(s)=7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb^-1 and 20.3 fb^-1, respectively. The WH production mode is studied in three and two lepton final states, while a four lepton final state is used to search for ZH production. The observed significance is of 2.5 standard deviations while a significance of 0.9 standard deviations is expected for a Standard Model Higgs boson. The ratio of the combined WH and ZH signal yield to the Standard Model expectation, μ_ VH, is found to be μ_ VH =3.0^+1.3_-1.1 ( stat.)^+1.0_-0.7 ( sys.) for a Higgs boson mass of 125.36 GeV. The WH and ZH channels are also combined with the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes studied in the H → WW^* →ℓνℓν decay channel. The results are interpreted in terms of scaling factors of the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons (k_V) and fermions (k_F), the combined results are: |k_V| = 1.06^+0.10_-0.10, |k_F| = 0.85^+0.26_-0.20.

"Search for dark photons in Higgs boson production via vector boson fusion in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is presented for a Higgs boson that is produced via vector boson fusion and that decays to an undetected particle and an isolated photon. The search is performed by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC, using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 130 fb^-1, recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016-2018. No significant excess of events above the expectation from the standard model background is found. The results are interpreted in the context of a theoretical model in which the undetected particle is a massless dark photon. An upper limit is set on the product of the cross section for production via vector boson fusion and the branching fraction for such a Higgs boson decay, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, assuming the standard model production rates, the observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit on the branching fraction is 3.4 (2.7)%. This is the first search for such decays in the vector boson fusion channel.

"Search for the Higgs boson produced in association with a W boson and decaying to four b-quarks via two spin-zero particles in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This paper presents a dedicated search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson to a pair of new spin-zero particles, H → aa, where the particle a decays to b-quarks and has a mass in the range of 20-60 GeV. The search is performed in events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W boson, giving rise to a signature of a lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum, and multiple jets from b-quark decays. The analysis is based on the full dataset of pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb^-1. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model prediction is observed, and a 95

"Search for electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in final states with a Higgs boson in pp collisions at 8 TeV. This note reports the results for searches for the direct electroweak production of supersymmetric charginos and neutralinos in final states with a Higgs boson. The data sample consists of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb^-1. The signature consists of a chargino-neutralino pair decaying to a W boson, a Higgs boson, and missing transverse energy from escaping lightest supersymmetric particles. The data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds. The results are interpreted to probe charginos and neutralinos with masses up to 204 GeV.

"Search for beyond the standard model Higgs bosons decaying into a bb pair in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for Higgs bosons that decay into a bottom quark-antiquark pair and are accompanied by at least one additional bottom quark is performed with the CMS detector. The data analyzed were recorded in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.7 fb^â1. The final state considered in this analysis is particularly sensitive to signatures of a Higgs sector beyond the standard model, as predicted in the generic class of two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs). No signal above the standard model background expectation is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are set for Higgs bosons with masses up to 1300 GeV. The results are interpreted within several MSSM and 2HDM scenarios.

"Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decay to μ^+μ^- with the ATLAS detector. A search is reported for Higgs boson decay to μ^+μ^- using data with an integrated luminosity of 24.8 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s)=7 and 8 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The observed dimuon invariant mass distribution is consistent with the Standard Model background-only hypothesis in the 120–150 GeV search range. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.5 GeV, the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 7.0 (7.2) times the Standard Model expectation. This corresponds to an upper limit on the branching ratio BR(H →μ^+μ^-) of 1.5×10^-3.

"Measurement of the production cross section for a Higgs boson in association with a vector boson in the H → WW^∗→ℓνℓν channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A measurement of the Higgs boson production cross sections via associated WH and ZH production using H → WW^∗→ℓνℓν decays, where ℓ stands for either an electron or a muon, is presented. Results for combined WH and ZH production are also presented. The analysis uses events produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

"Search for Physics Beyond the Standard Model in Events with High-Momentum Higgs Bosons and Missing Transverse Momentum in Proton-Proton Collisions at 13Â TeV. A search for physics beyond the standard model in events with one or more high-momentum Higgs bosons, H, decaying to pairs of b quarks in association with missing transverse momentum is presented. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV. The analysis utilizes a new b quark tagging technique based on jet substructure to identify jets from H→bb̅. Events are categorized by the multiplicity of H-tagged jets, jet mass, and the missing transverse momentum. No significant deviation from standard model expectations is observed. In the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), limits on the cross sections of pair-produced gluinos are set, assuming that gluinos decay to quark pairs, H (or Z), and the lightest SUSY particle, LSP, through an intermediate next-to-lightest SUSY particle, NLSP.

"Search for resonant pair production of Higgs bosons decaying to bb̅ and τ^+τ^- in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for a massive resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons, one of which decays to a pair of τ leptons and the other to a pair of bottom quarks, is presented. This analysis is based on the proton-proton collisions data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at CMS in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. For a high-mass (≳ 1 TeV) resonance, the hadronization products of the bottom quarks coming from one of the two intermediate H bosons give rise to the presence of one single “merged” jet, which can be identified through a study of its substructure consistent with the presence of bottom quarks. Due to the large boost of the intermediate H boson, the two tau leptons are similarly overlapping. Advanced techniques are used for their reconstruction and identification in events where one τ decays hadronically and the other one decays into an electron or a muon. Upper limits at 95

"Search for associated production of dark matter with a Higgs boson that decays to a pair of bottom quarks. A search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson that decays into a pair of bottom quarks is performed in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a bb̅ system that has a large Lorentz boost. The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction. Results are interpreted in terms of limits on parameters in the Baryonic Z' and 2HDM+a simplified models. For these models, the presented results constitute either the most stringent constraints or the first constraints obtained so far.
