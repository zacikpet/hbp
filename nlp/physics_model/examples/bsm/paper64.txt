A search for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bb̅τ^+τ^- decay channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for resonant and non-resonant pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb̅τ^+τ^- final state is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collision data with √(s)= 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The semileptonic and fully hadronic decays of the τ-lepton pair are considered. No significant excess above the expected background is observed in the data. The cross-section times branching ratio for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is constrained to be less than 30.9 fb, 12.7 times the Standard Model expectation, at 95% confidence level. The data are also analyzed to probe resonant Higgs boson pair production, constraining a model with an extended Higgs sector based on two doublets and a Randall-Sundrum bulk graviton model. Upper limits are placed on the resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section times branching ratio, excluding resonances X in the mass range 305 GeV < m_X < 402 GeV in the simplified hMSSM minimal supersymmetric model for tanβ=2 and excluding bulk Randall-Sundrum gravitons G_KK in the mass range 325 GeV < m_G_KK < 885 GeV for k/M_Pl = 1.
