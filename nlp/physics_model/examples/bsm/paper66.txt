Search for a heavy Higgs boson in the H to ZZ to 2l2nu channel in pp collisions at sqrt(s)= 7 and 8 TeV. A search for a heavy Higgs boson in the H→ ZZ→ 2ℓ 2ν decay channel, where ℓ = e or μ, in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of both 7 and 8 TeV is presented. The data were collected at the LHC, with the CMS detector, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and 19.6 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. The search is optimised separately for the vector boson fusion and the gluon fusion production processes. No significant excess is observed above the background expectation. The presence of a standard model-like Higgs boson with a mass in the 248–930 GeV range is excluded at 95 extension of the Standard Model is presented as well.
