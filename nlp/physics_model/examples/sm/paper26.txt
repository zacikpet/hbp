Combination of Higgs Boson Searches with up to 4.9 fb-1 of pp Collisions Data Taken at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the ATLAS Experiment at the LHC. A preliminary combination of Standard Model Higgs searches with the ATLAS experiment, in a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 4.9 fbâ1 of pp collisions collected at âs = 7 TeV at the LHC, is presented. The Higgs boson mass ranges from 112.7 GeV to 115.5 GeV, 131 GeV to 237 GeV and 251 GeV to 468 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level (C.L.), while the expected Higgs boson mass exclusion in the absence of a signal ranges from 124.6 GeV to 520 GeV. An excess of events is observed for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis close to mH =126 GeV. The maximum local significance of this excess is 3.6Ï above the expected SM background, while the global probability of such a fluctuation to happen anywhere in the full explored Higgs mass domain is estimated to be approximately 1%, corresponding to a global significance of 2.3Ï . The three most sensitive channelsinthismassrange,HâÎ³Î³,HâZZ(â)âl+lâl+lâ andHâWW(â)âl+Î½lâÎ½, contribute individual local significances of 2.8Ï , 2.1Ï and 1.4Ï , respectively, to the excess.
