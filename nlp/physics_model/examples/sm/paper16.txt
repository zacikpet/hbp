Inclusive search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV using H→bb̅ decays. A search for the standard model Higgs boson produced with high transverse momentum decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair has been performed using a data set of pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. A high-transverse-momentum Higgs boson decaying to bb̅ is reconstructed as a single jet and identified based on jet substructure and dedicated b-tagging techniques. The analysis strategy is validated with Z→bb̅ decays. The Z→bb̅ process is observed with a local significance of 5.1 standard deviations for the first time in the single jet topology. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events is observed above the expected background with a local significance of 1.5 standard deviations. The measured cross section of H(bb̅) production for p_T>450 GeV is 74_-49^+51 fb.
