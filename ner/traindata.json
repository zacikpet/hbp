This paper describes a measurement of fiducial and differential cross sections of gluon-fusion Higgs boson production in the H\u2192 WW^\u2217\u2192 e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd channel, using 20.3 fb^-1 of proton\u2013proton collision data. The data were produced at a centre-of-mass energy of \u221a(s) = 8 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2012.  Cross sections are measured from the observed H\u2192 WW^\u2217\u2192 e\u03bd\u03bc\u03bd signal yield in categories distinguished by the number of associated jets. The total cross section is measured in a fiducial region defined by the kinematic properties of the charged leptons and neutrinos. Differential cross sections are reported as a function of the number of jets, the Higgs boson transverse momentum, the dilepton rapidity, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet.  The jet-veto efficiency, or fraction of events with no jets above a given transverse momentum threshold, is also reported.  All measurements are compared to QCD predictions from Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order calculations, and are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.",

A direct search for the standard model Higgs boson, H, produced in association with a vector boson, V (W or Z), and decaying to a charm quark pair is presented. The search uses a data set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search is carried out in mutually exclusive channels targeting specific decays of the vector bosons: W\u2192\u2113\u03bd, Z\u2192\u2113\u2113, and Z\u2192\u03bd\u03bd, where \u2113 is an electron or a muon. To fully exploit the topology of the H boson decay, two strategies are followed. In the first one, targeting lower vector boson transverse momentum, the H boson candidate is reconstructed via two resolved jets arising from the two charm quarks from the H boson decay. A second strategy identifies the case where the two charm quark jets from the H boson decay merge to form a single jet, which generally only occurs when the vector boson has higher transverse momentum. Both strategies make use of novel methods for charm jet identification, while jet substructure techniques are also exploited to suppress the background in the merged-jet topology. The two analyses are combined to yield a 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limit on the cross section \u03c3(VH)\u212c(H\u2192cc\u0305) of 4.5 (2.4^+1.0_-0.7) pb, corresponding to 70 (37) times the standard model prediction.",

Cross-section measurements for the production of a Higgs boson through gluon-gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, and in association with a vector bosonor a top-quark pair are reported. The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the observed to the expected signal yield, is measured for each of these production processes as well as inclusively. The global signal strength measurement of 0.99 \u00b1 0.14 improves on the precision of the ATLAS measurement at \u221a(s) = 7 and 8 TeV by a factor of two. Measurements of gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion productions yield signal strengths compatible with the Standard Model prediction. Measurements of simplified template cross sections, designed to quantify the different Higgs boson production processes in specific regions of phase space, are reported. The cross section for the production of the Higgs boson decaying to two isolated photons in a fiducial region closely matching the experimental selection of the photons is measured to be 55 \u00b1 10 fb, which is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 64 \u00b1 2 fb. Furthermore, cross sections in fiducial regions enriched in Higgs boson production in vector-boson fusion or in association with large missing transverse momentum, leptons or top-quark pairs are reported. Differential and double-differential measurements are performed for several variables related to the diphoton kinematics as well as the kinematics and multiplicity of the jets produced in association with a Higgs boson.

A search for a standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair and decaying to bottom quarks is presented. Events with hadronic jets and one or two oppositely charged leptons are selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb^-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. In order to separate the signal from the larger t t\u0305+jets background, this analysis uses a matrix element method that assigns a probability density value to each reconstructed event under signal or background hypotheses. The ratio between the two values is used in a maximum likelihood fit to extract the signal yield. The results are presented in terms of the measured signal strength modifier, \u03bc, relative to the standard model prediction for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The observed (expected) exclusion limit at a 95% confidence level is \u03bc lower than 4.2 (3.3), corresponding to a best fit value \u03bc\u0302=1.2^+1.6_-1.5.",

A search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing high-p_ T jets, missing transverse momentum and no electrons or muons is presented. The data were recorded in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment in \u221a(s)=8 TeV proton\u2013proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, with a total integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1. No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed. Results are interpreted in a variety of simplified and specific supersymmetry-breaking models assuming that R-parity is conserved and that the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle. An exclusion limit at the 95% confidence level on the mass of the gluino is set at 1330 GeV for a simplified model incorporating only a gluino and the lightest neutralino. For a simplified model involving the strong production of first- and second-generation squarks, squark masses below 850 GeV (440 GeV) are excluded for a massless lightest neutralino, assuming mass degenerate (single light-flavour) squarks. In mSUGRA/CMSSM models with tan\u03b2=30, A_0=-2m_0 and \u03bc> 0, squarks and gluinos of equal mass are excluded for masses below 1700 GeV. Additional limits are set for non-universal Higgs mass models with gaugino mediation and for simplified models involving the pair production of gluinos, each decaying to a top squark and a top quark, with the top squark decaying to a charm quark and a neutralino. These limits extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous searches with the ATLAS detector.",

The fragmentation of high-energy gluons at small opening angles is largely unconstrained by present measurements.  Gluon splitting to b-quark pairs is a unique probe into the properties of gluon fragmentation because identified b-tagged jets provide a proxy for the quark daughters of the initial gluon.  In this study, key differential distributions related to the g\u2192 bb\u0305 process are measured using 33 fb^-1 of \u221a(s)=13 TeV pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2016.  Jets constructed from charged-particle tracks, clustered with the anti-k_t jet algorithm with radius parameter R = 0.2, are used to probe angular scales below the R=0.4 jet radius.  The observables are unfolded to particle level in order to facilitate direct comparisons with predictions from present and future simulations.  Multiple significant differences are observed between the data and parton shower Monte Carlo predictions, providing input to improve these predictions of the main source of background events in analyses involving boosted Higgs bosons decaying into b-quarks.",

A search for heavy pseudoscalar (A) and scalar (H) Higgs bosons decaying into a top quark pair (tt\u0305) has been performed with 20.3 fb^-1 of proton\u2013proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of \u221a(s) = 8 TeV.

No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed in the tt\u0305 invariant mass spectrum in final states with an electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets. The results are interpreted within the context of a type-II two-Higgs-doublet model.

A new scalar resonance, called the radion, with couplings to fermions and bosons similar to those of the Higgs boson, is predicted in the framework of Randall-Sundrum models, proposed solutions to the hierarchy problem with one extra dimension. An important distinction between the radion and the Higgs boson is that the radion would couple directly to gluon pairs, and in particular its decay products would include a significant fraction of gluon jets. The radion had the same quantum numbers as the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, and therefore they can mix, with the resulting mass eigenstates having properties different from those of the SM Higgs boson. Existing searches for the Higgs boson are sensitive to the possible production and decay of radions and Higgs bosons in these models. For the first time, searches for the SM Higgs boson and flavour-independent and decay-mode independent searches for a neutral Higgs boson are used in combination to explore the parameter space of the Randall-Sundrum model. In the dataset recorded by the OPAL experiment at LEP, no evidence for radion or Higgs particle production was observed in any of those searches. The results are used to set limits on the radion and Higgs boson masses.",

The measurement of the Higgs boson lifetime is derived from its flight distance in the CMS detector with an upper bound of \u03c4_H lower than 1.9 \u00d7 10^-13 s at the 95% confidence level (CL), corresponding to a lower bound on the width of \u0393_H larger than 3.5 \u00d7 10^-9 MeV. The measurement of the width is obtained from an off-shell production technique, generalized to include anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to two electroweak bosons. From this measurement, a joint constraint is set on the Higgs boson width and a parameter f_\u039b Q that expresses an anomalous coupling contribution as an on-shell cross-section fraction. The limit on the Higgs boson width is \u0393_H lower than 46 MeV with f_\u039b Q unconstrained and \u0393_H lower than 26 MeV for f_\u039b Q=0 at the 95% CL.

A statistical combination of searches is presented for massive resonances decaying to WW, WZ, ZZ, WH, and ZH boson pairs in proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data are taken at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to respective integrated luminosities of 19.7 and up to 2.7 inverse femtobarns. The results are interpreted in the context of heavy vector triplet and singlet models that mimic properties of composite-Higgs models predicting W' and Z' bosons decaying to WZ, WW, WH, and ZH bosons. A model with a bulk graviton that decays into WW and ZZ is also considered. This is the first combined search for WW, WZ, WH, and ZH resonances and yields lower limits on masses at 95% confidence level for W' and Z' singlets at 2.3 TeV, and for a triplet at 2.4 TeV. The limits on the production cross section of a narrow bulk graviton resonance with the curvature scale of the warped extra dimension k = 0.5, in the mass range of 0.6 to 4.0 TeV, are the most stringent published to date.",

Results are presented for an extraction of the top quark Yukawa coupling from top quark-antiquark (tt\u0305) kinematic distributions in the lepton plus jets final state in proton-proton collisions, based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at \u221a(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.8 fb^-1. Corrections from weak boson exchange, including Higgs bosons, between the top quarks can produce large distortions of differential distributions near the energy threshold of tt\u0305 production. Therefore, precise measurements of these distributions are sensitive to the Yukawa coupling. Top quark events are reconstructed with at least three jets in the final state, and a novel technique is introduced to reconstruct the tt\u0305 system for events with one missing jet. This technique enhances the experimental sensitivity in the low invariant mass region, M_tt\u0305. The data yields in M_tt\u0305, the rapidity difference |y_t-y_t\u0305|, and the number of reconstructed jets are compared with distributions representing different Yukawa couplings. These comparisons are used to measure the ratio of the top quark Yukawa coupling to its standard model predicted value to be 1.07^+0.34_-0.43 with an upper limit of 1.67 at the 95% confidence level.",

A generic search for anomalous production of events with at least three charged leptons is presented. The search uses a pp-collision data sample at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV corresponding to 4.6 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Events are required to contain at least two electrons or muons, while the third lepton may either be an additional electron or muon, or a hadronically decaying tau lepton. Events are categorized by the presence or absence of a reconstructed tau-lepton or Z-boson candidate decaying to leptons. No significant excess above backgrounds expected from Standard Model processes is observed. Results are presented as upper limits on event yields from non-Standard-Model processes producing at least three prompt, isolated leptons, given as functions of lower bounds on several kinematic variables. Fiducial efficiencies for model testing are also provided. The use of the results is illustrated by setting upper limits on the production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons decaying to same-sign lepton pairs.",

During 1997 the ALEPH experiment at LEP gathered 57 pb of data at centre-of-mass energies near 183 GeV. These data are used to look for possible signals from the production of the Standard Model Higgs boson in the reaction ee \u2013> HZ. No evidence of a signal is found in the data; seven events are selected, in agreement with the expectation of 7.2 events from background processes. This observation results in an improved lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson: mH > 87.9 GeV/c2 at 95% confidence level.Searches for Higgs boson pair production in the hh\u2192 bb\u03c4\u03c4, \u03b3\u03b3 WW*, \u03b3\u03b3 bb, bbbb channels with the ATLAS detector. Searches for both resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production are performed in the hh\u2192 bb\u03c4\u03c4, \u03b3\u03b3 WW^* final states using 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of their production is observed and 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross sections are set. These results are then combined with the published results of the hh\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 bb, bbbb analyses. An upper limit of 0.69 (0.47) pb on the non-resonant Standard Model like hh production is observed (expected), corresponding to 70 (48) times of the SM gg\u2192 hh cross section. For production via narrow resonances, cross section limits of hh production from a heavy Higgs boson decay are set as a function of the heavy Higgs boson mass. The observed (expected) limits range from 2.1 (1.1) pb at 260 GeV to 0.011 (0.018) pb at 1000 GeV. These results are interpreted in the context of two simplified scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.",

The Higgs boson candidates are selected in events with two or three charged leptons. An excess of events above background is observed, consistent with the expectation from the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV. The probability to observe an excess equal or larger than the one seen, under the background-only hypothesis, corresponds to a significance of 4.3 standard deviations for m_H = 125.6 GeV. The observed signal cross section times the branching fraction to WW for m_H = 125.6 GeV is 0.72^+0.20_-0.18 times the standard model expectation. The spin-parity J_P=0^+ hypothesis is favored against a narrow resonance with J_P=2^+ or J_P=0^- that decays to a W-boson pair.

This paper presents a search for direct top squark pair production in events with missing transverse momentum plus either a pair of jets consistent with Standard Model Higgs boson decay into b-quarks or a same-flavour opposite-sign dilepton pair with an invariant mass consistent with a Z boson. The analysis is performed using the proton-proton collision data at \u221a(s)=13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector during the LHC Run-2, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. No excess is observed in the data above the Standard Model predictions. The results are interpreted in simplified models featuring direct production of pairs of either the lighter top squark (t\u0303_1) or the heavier top squark (t\u0303_2), excluding at 95% confidence level t\u0303_1 and t\u0303_2 masses up to about 1220 and 875 GeV, respectively.",

Events containing a photon and a Lorentz-boosted hadronically decaying Higgs boson that is reconstructed as a single, large-radius jet are considered, and the \u03b3+jet invariant mass spectrum is analyzed for the presence of narrow resonances. To increase the sensitivity of the search, events are categorized depending on whether the large-radius jet can be identified as a result of the merging of two jets originating from b quarks. Results in both categories are found to agree with the predictions of the standard model. Upper limits on the production of H\u03b3 resonances are set as a function of the resonance mass in the range of 720-3250 GeV, representing the most stringent constraints to date.",

Differential Higgs boson (H) production cross sections are sensitive probes for physics beyond the standard model. New physics may contribute in the gluon-gluon fusion loop, the dominant Higgs boson production mechanism at the LHC, and manifest itself through deviations from the distributions predicted by the standard model. Combined spectra for the H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3, H\u2192ZZ, and H\u2192bb\u0305 decay channels and the inclusive Higgs boson production cross section are presented, based on proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at \u221a(s)= 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The transverse momentum spectrum is used to place limits on the Higgs boson couplings to the top, bottom, and charm quarks, as well as its direct coupling to the gluon field. No significant deviations from the standard model are observed in any differential distribution. The measured total cross section is 61.1 \u00b1 6.0 (stat) \u00b1 3.7 (syst) pb, and the precision of the measurement of the differential cross section of the Higgs boson transverse momentum is improved by about 15% with respect to the H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 channel alone.",

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. The search is inclusive in the Higgs boson production mode. Highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons decaying to bb\u0305 are reconstructed as single large-radius jets, and are identified using jet substructure and a dedicated b tagging technique based on a deep neural network. The method is validated with Z\u2192bb\u0305 decays.

Higgs boson candidates produced in association with zero, one or two jets are included in the analysis to maximize the acceptance for both gluon fusion and weak boson fusion Higgs boson production processes.

The best sensitivity is reached for m_H = 400 GeV, where the observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper bound on the cross section for H \u2192 WW produced in association with zero or one jet is 2.2 pb (1.9 pb), corresponding to 1.9 (1.6) times the Standard Model prediction. In the Higgs boson plus two jets channel, which is more sensitive to the weak boson fusion process, the observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper bound on the cross section for H \u2192 WW production with m_H = 400 GeV is 0.7 pb (0.6 pb), corresponding to 7.9 (6.5) times the Standard Model prediction.",

This analysis uses the full dataset recorded in 2012: 20.3 fb^-1 of proton\u2013proton collision data at \u221a(s) = 8 TeV. The search employs techniques for reconstructing decay vertices of long-lived particles decaying to jets in the inner tracking detector and muon spectrometer. Signal events require at least two reconstructed vertices. No significant excess of events over the expected background is found, and limits as a function of proper lifetime are reported for the decay of the Higgs boson and other scalar bosons to long-lived particles and for Hidden Valley Z^' and Stealth SUSY benchmark models. The first search results for displaced decays in Z^' and Stealth SUSY models are presented. The upper bounds of the excluded proper lifetimes are the most stringent to date.",

A search is presented for decays of Z and Higgs bosons to a J/\u03c8 meson and a photon, with the subsequent decay of the J/\u03c8 to \u03bc^+\u03bc^-. The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 at \u221a(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The observed limit on the Z \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 decay branching fraction, assuming that the J/\u03c8 meson is produced unpolarized, is 1.4 \u00d7 10^-6 at 95% confidence level, which corresponds to a rate higher than expected in the standard model by a factor of 15. For extreme-polarization scenarios, the observed limit changes from -13.6 to +8.6% with respect to the unpolarized scenario. The observed upper limit on the branching fraction for H \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 where the J/\u03c8 meson is assumed to be transversely polarized is 7.6 \u00d7 10^-4, a factor of 260 larger than the standard model prediction. The results for the Higgs boson are combined with previous data from proton-proton collisions at \u221a(s) = 8 TeV to produce an observed upper limit on the branching fraction for H \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 that is a factor of 220 larger than the standard model value.",

Combined analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as its coupling strengths to vector bosons and fermions are presented. The combinations include the results of the analyses of the H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3,  ZZ^*,  WW^*,  Z\u03b3,  bb\u0305, \u03c4\u03c4 and \u03bc\u03bc decay modes, and the constraints on the associated production with a pair of top quarks and on the off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson. The results are based on the LHC proton\u2013proton collision datasets, with integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 fb^-1 at \u221a(s)=7 TeV and 20.3 fb^-1 at \u221a(s)=8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and 2012. Combining all production modes and decay channels, the measured signal yield, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, is 1.18^+0.15_-0.14. The data provide unequivocal confirmation of the gluon fusion production of the Higgs boson, strong evidence of vector-boson fusion production and support Standard Model assumptions of production in association with vector bosons or a pair of top quarks. The observed Higgs boson production and decay rates are interpreted in a leading-order coupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both with and without assumptions on the Higgs boson width and on the Standard Model particle content in loop processes. Generic Higgs boson coupling models that allow measurement of coupling strengths to \u03bc, \u03c4 leptons, b, t quarks and W, Z bosons, or ratios of these coupling strengths, are presented. The observed data are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations for a Higgs boson at a mass of 125.36 GeV for all models considered.",

This paper describes a topological search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson,H, produced via the Bjorken process (e+e- -> HZ). The analysis is based on data recorded using the OPAL detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies from 183 to 209 GeV corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 629pb-1. In the analysis only hadronic decays of the Z boson are considered. A scan over Higgs boson masses from 1 to 120 GeV and decay widths from 1 to 3000 GeV revealed no indication for a signal in the data. From a likelihood ratio of expected signal and Standard Model background we determine upper limits on cross-section times branching ratio to an invisible final state. For moderate Higgs boson decay widths, these range from about 0.07pb Mh = 60GeV) to 0.57pb (Mh = 114GeV). For decay widths above 200GeV the upper limits are of the order of 0.15pb. The results can be interpreted in general scenarios predicting a large invisible decay width of the Higgs boson. As an example we interpret the results in the so-called stealthy Higgs scenario. The limits from this analysis exclude a large part of the parameter range of this scenario experimentally accessible at LEP2.",

Combined measurements of Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions are presented. The combination is based on the analyses of the Higgs boson decay modes H \u2192\u03b3\u03b3, ZZ^\u2217, WW^\u2217, \u03c4\u03c4, bb\u0305, \u03bc\u03bc, searches for decays into invisible final states, and on measurements of off-shell Higgs boson production. Up to 79.8 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at \u221a(s)= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector are used. Results are presented for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes, and for associated production with vector bosons or top-quarks. The global signal strength is determined to be \u03bc = 1.11^+0.09_-0.08. The combined measurement yields an observed (expected) significance for the vector-boson fusion production process of 6.5\u03c3 (5.3\u03c3). Measurements in kinematic regions defined within the simplified template cross section framework are also shown. The results are interpreted in terms of modifiers applied to the Standard Model couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles, and are used to set exclusion limits on parameters in two-Higgs-doublet models and in the simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed.",

The search targets T quarks decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson in fully hadronic final states. For a T quark with mass above 1 TeV the daughter top quark and Higgs boson are highly Lorentz-boosted and can each appear as a single hadronic jet. Jet substructure and b tagging techniques are used to identify the top quark and Higgs boson jets, and to suppress the standard model backgrounds. An excess of events is searched for in the T quark candidate mass distribution in the data, which is found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the single T quark production cross sections and the branching fraction \u212c(T\u2192 t  H ), and these vary between 0.31 and 0.93 pb for T quark masses in the range 1000-1800 GeV.

A search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is presented where at least one Higgs boson is produced and decays to two photons in the decay chains of pair-produced SUSY particles. Two complementary analysis strategies are pursued: one focused on strong SUSY production and the other focused on electroweak SUSY production. The presence of charged leptons, additional Higgs boson candidates, and various kinematic variables are used to categorize events into search regions that are sensitive to different SUSY scenarios. The results are based on data from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.5 fb^-1. No statistically significant excess of events is observed relative to the standard model expectations. We exclude bottom squark pair production for bottom squark masses below 530 GeV and a lightest SUSY particle mass of 1 GeV; wino-like chargino-neutralino production for chargino and neutralino masses below 235 GeV with a gravitino mass of 1 GeV; and higgsino-like chargino-neutralino production in the case where the neutralino decays exclusively to a Higgs boson and a gravitino for neutralino masses below 290 GeV.",

        "content": "Precise Determination of the Z Resonance Parameters at LEP : Zedometry. This final analysis of hadronic and leptonic cross-sections and of leptonic forward-backward asymmetries in e+e- collisions with the OPAL detector makes use of the full LEP1 data sample comprising 161 pb^-1 of integrated luminosity and 4.5 x 10^6 selected Z decays. An interpretation of the data in terms of contributions from pure Z exchange and from Z-gamma interference allows the parameters of the Z resonance to be determined in a model-independent way. Our results are in good agreement with lepton universality and consistent with the vector and axial-vector couplings predicted in the Standard Model. A fit to the complete dataset yields the fundamental Z resonance parameters: mZ = 91.1852 +- 0.0030 GeV, GZ = 2.4948 +- 0.0041 GeV, s0h = 41.501 +- 0.055 nb, Rl = 20.823 +- 0.044, and Afb0l = 0.0145 +- 0.0017. Transforming these parameters gives a measurement of the ratio between the decay width into invisible particles and the width to a single species of charged lepton, Ginv/Gl = 5.942 +- 0.027. Attributing the entire invisible width to neutrino decays and assuming the Standard Model couplings for neutrinos, this translates into a measurement of the effective number of light neutrino species, N_nu = 2.984 +- 0.013. Interpreting the data within the context of the Standard Model allows the mass of the top quark, mt = 162 +29-16 GeV, to be determined through its influence on radiative corrections. Alternatively, utilising the direct external measurement of mt as an additional constraint leads to a measurement of the strong coupling constant and the mass of the Higgs boson: alfa_s(mZ) = 0.127 +- 0.005 and mH = 390 +750-280 GeV.",

Charged Higgs bosons produced in association with a single top quark and decaying via H^\u00b1\u2192\u03c4\u03bd are searched for with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, using proton\u2013proton collision data at \u221a(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb^-1. The final state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic \u03c4 decay and missing transverse momentum, as well as a hadronically decaying top quark, resulting in the absence of high-transverse-momentum electrons and muons. The data are found to be consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. A statistical analysis leads to 95% confidence-level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction, \u03c3(pp \u2192 [b]t H^\u00b1) \u00d7(H^\u00b1\u2192\u03c4\u03bd), between 1.9 pb and 15 fb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 200 to 2000 GeV.

A search is conducted for a low-mass charged Higgs boson produced in a top quark decay and subsequently decaying into a charm and a strange quark. The data sample was recorded in proton-proton collisions at \u221a(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search is performed in the process of top quark pair production, where one top quark decays to a bottom quark and a charged Higgs boson, and the other to a bottom quark and a W boson. With the W boson decaying to a charged lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino, the final state comprises an isolated lepton, missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets, of which two are tagged as b jets. To enhance the search sensitivity, one of the jets originating from the charged Higgs boson is required to satisfy a charm tagging selection. No significant excess beyond standard model predictions is found in the dijet invariant mass distribution. An upper limit in the range 1.68-0.25% is set on the branching fraction of the top quark decay to the charged Higgs boson and bottom quark for a charged Higgs boson mass between 80 and 160 GeV.",

This search focuses on the regime where the decay products are collimated and in the range 15 \u2264 m_a \u2264 30 GeV and is complementary to a previous search in the same final state targeting the regime where the decay products are well separated and in the range 20 \u2264 m_a \u2264 60 GeV. A novel strategy for the identification of the a \u2192 bb\u0305 decays is deployed to enhance the efficiency for topologies with small separation angles. The search is performed with 36 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected in 2015 and 2016 and sets upper limits on the production cross-section of H \u2192 aa \u2192 (bb\u0305)(bb\u0305), where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z boson.",

The search is performed by the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1 recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess of events above the expectation from the standard model background is found. The results are interpreted in the context of a theoretical model in which the undetected particle is a massless dark photon. An upper limit is set on the product of the cross section for associated Higgs and Z boson production and the branching fraction for such a Higgs boson decay, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. For a mass of 125 GeV, assuming the standard model production cross section, this corresponds to an observed (expected) upper limit on this branching fraction of 4.6 (3.6)% at 95% confidence level.

A search for a charged Higgs boson, H^\u00b1, decaying to a W^\u00b1 boson and a Z boson is presented. The search is based on 20.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The H^\u00b1 boson is assumed to be produced via vector-boson fusion and the decays W^\u00b1\u2192 qq\u0305^\u0305'\u0305 and Z\u2192 e^+e^-/\u03bc^+\u03bc^- are considered. The search is performed in a range of charged Higgs boson masses from 200 to 1000 GeV. No evidence for the production of an H^\u00b1 boson is observed. Upper limits of 31\u20131020 fb at 95% CL are placed on the cross section for vector-boson fusion production of an H^\u00b1 boson times its branching fraction to W^\u00b1 Z. The limits are compared with predictions from the Georgi-Machacek Higgs Triplet Model.",

A search is described for the generic process e+e- to X Y, where X is a neutral heavy scalar boson decaying into a pair of photons, and Y is a neutral heavy boson (scalar or vector) decaying into a fermion pair. The search is motivated mainly by the cases where either X, or both X and Y, are Higgs bosons. In particular, we investigate the case where X is the Standard Model Higgs boson and Y the Z0 boson. Other models with enhanced Higgs boson decay couplings to photon pairs are also considered. The present search combines the data set collected by the OPAL collaboration at 189 GeV collider energy, having an integrated luminosity of 182.6pb-1, with data samples collected at lower energies. The search results have been used to put 95% confidence level bounds, as functions of the mass of X, on the product of the cross-section and the relevant branching ratios, both in a model independent manner and for the particular models considered.",

Results are presented from a search for production of Higgs boson pairs (HH) where one boson decays to a pair of b quarks and the other to a \u03c4 lepton pair. This work is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at \u221a(s) = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.3 fb^-1. Resonant and non-resonant modes of HH production have been probed and no significant excess relative to the background-only hypotheses has been found in either mode. Upper limits on cross sections of the two HH production modes have been set. The results have been combined with previously published searches at \u221a(s) = 8 TeV, in decay modes to two photons and two b quarks, as well as to four b quarks, which also show no evidence for a signal. Limits from the combination have been set on resonant HH production by an unknown particle X in the mass range m_X = 300 GeV to m_X = 1000 GeV. For resonant production of spin 0 (spin 2) particles, the observed 95% CL upper limit is 1.13 pb (1.09 pb) at m_X = 300 GeV and to 21 fb (18 fb) at m_X = 1000 GeV. For non-resonant HH production, a limit of 43 times the rate predicted by the standard model has been set.",

Simultaneous measurements of the tt\u0305, W^+W^-, and Z/\u03b3^*\u2192\u03c4\u03c4 production cross-sections using an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb^-1 of pp collisions at \u221a(s) = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. Events are selected with two high transverse momentum leptons consisting of an oppositely charged electron and muon pair. The three processes are separated using the distributions of the missing transverse momentum of events with zero and greater than zero jet multiplicities. Measurements of the fiducial cross-section are presented along with results that quantify for the first time the underlying correlations in the predicted and measured cross-sections due to proton parton distribution functions. These results indicate that the correlated NLO predictions for tt\u0305 and Z/\u03b3^*\u2192\u03c4\u03c4 significantly underestimate the data, while those at NNLO generally describe the data well. The full cross-sections are measured to be \u03c3(tt\u0305) = 181.2 \u00b1 2.8^+9.7_-9.5\u00b1 3.3 \u00b1 3.3 pb, \u03c3(W^+W^-) = 53.3 \u00b1 2.7^+7.3_-8.0\u00b1 1.0 \u00b1 0.5 pb, and \u03c3(Z/\u03b3^*\u2192\u03c4\u03c4) = 1174 \u00b1 24^+72_-87\u00b1 21 \u00b1 9 pb, where the cited uncertainties are due to statistics, systematic effects, luminosity and the LHC beam energy measurement, respectively.",

A search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons is performed for the first time in the final state with two b quarks and two \u03c4 leptons. The search is motivated in the context of models of physics beyond the standard model (SM), such as two Higgs doublet models extended with a complex scalar singlet (2HDM+S), which include the next-to-minimal supersymmetric SM (NMSSM). The results are based on a data set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15 and 60 GeV are probed, and no excess of events above the SM expectation is observed. Upper limits between 3 and 12% are set on the branching fraction \u212c(h \u2192 aa \u2192 2\u03c42b) assuming the SM production of the Higgs boson. Upper limits are also set on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to two light pseudoscalar bosons in different 2HDM+S scenarios. Assuming the SM production cross section for the Higgs boson, the upper limit on this quantity is as low as 20% for a mass of the pseudoscalar of 40 GeV in the NMSSM.",

These decays are reconstructed from calorimeter jets found with the anti-k_t R = 1.0 jet algorithm. To tag Higgs bosons, a combination of requirements is used: b-tagging of R = 0.2 track-jets matched to the large-R calorimeter jet, and requirements on the jet mass and other jet substructure variables. The Higgs boson tagging efficiency and corresponding multijet and hadronic top-quark background rejections are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Several benchmark tagging selections are defined for different signal efficiency targets. The modelling of the relevant input distributions used to tag Higgs bosons is studied in 36 fb^-1 of data collected in 2015 and 2016 using g\u2192 bb\u0305 and Z(\u2192 bb\u0305)\u03b3 event selections in data.

A search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in pp collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 inverse picobarns recorded by the CMS experiment. The search uses decays of the Higgs bosons to tau pairs. No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. The resulting upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, yield stringent new bounds in the MSSM parameter space.",

A search is presented for the production of two Higgs bosons in final states containing two photons and two bottom quarks. Both resonant and nonresonant hypotheses are investigated. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at \u221a(s) = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector. Good agreement is observed between data and predictions of the standard model (SM). Upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of new particles and compared to the prediction for the existence of a warped extra dimension. When the decay to two Higgs bosons is kinematically allowed, assuming a mass scale \u039b_R = 1 TeV for the model, the data exclude a radion scalar at masses below 980 GeV. The first Kaluza\u2013Klein excitation mode of the graviton in Randall\u2013Sundrum models is excluded for masses between 325 and 450 GeV. Limits set on nonresonant production constrain the parameter space for anomalous Higgs boson couplings.",
