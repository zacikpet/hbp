Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in e^+ e^- interactions at âˆš(s) = 183 GeV. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson is performed with the L3 detector at LEP. The data sample, corresponding to a luminosity of 55.3 pb^-1, was collected at an average centre-of-mass energy of 182.7 GeV. No Higgs signal is observed, leading to a lower limit on the Higgs boson mass of 87.6 GeV at the 95% confidence level.
