The data correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$.

No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed.  $H^{\\pm\\pm}$ bosons are excluded at 95% confidence level up to 350 GeV and 230 GeV for the pair and associated production modes, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Electroweak symmetry breaking explains the origin of the masses of elementary particles via their interactions with the Higgs field. Besides the measurements of the Higgs boson properties, the study of the scattering of massive vector bosons (with spin one) at the Large Hadron Collider allows to probe the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking with an unprecedented sensitivity. Among all processes related to vector-boson scattering, the electroweak production of two jets and a $Z$-boson pair is a rare and important one. This article reports on the first observation of this process using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$ recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector. Two different final states originating from the decays of the $Z$-boson pair, one containing four charged leptons and the other containing two charged leptons and two neutrinos, are considered. The hypothesis of no electroweak production is rejected with a statistical significance of 5.5 $\\sigma$, and the measured cross-section for electroweak production is consistent with the Standard Model prediction. In addition, cross-sections for inclusive production of a $Z$-boson pair and two jets are reported for the two final states.",

To tag Higgs bosons, a combination of requirements is used: $b$-tagging of $R = 0.2$ track-jets matched to the large-$R$ calorimeter jet, and requirements on the jet mass and other jet substructure variables. The Higgs boson tagging efficiency and corresponding multijet and hadronic top-quark background rejections are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Several benchmark tagging selections are defined for different signal efficiency targets. The modelling of the relevant input distributions used to tag Higgs bosons is studied in 36 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in 2015 and 2016 using $g\\to b\\bar{b}$ and $Z(\\rightarrow b\\bar{b})\\gamma$ event selections in data.

Three benchmark signals are studied: a spin-2 graviton decaying into a Higgs boson pair, a scalar resonance decaying into a Higgs boson pair, and Standard Model non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Two analyses are carried out, each implementing a particular technique for the event reconstruction that targets Higgs bosons reconstructed as pairs of jets or single boosted jets. The resonance mass range covered is 260--3000 GeV. The analyses are statistically combined and upper limits on the production cross section of Higgs boson pairs times branching ratio to $b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}$ are set in each model. No significant excess is observed; the largest deviation of data over prediction is found at a mass of 280 GeV, corresponding to 2.3 standard deviations globally. The observed 95% confidence level upper limit on the non-resonant production is 13 times the Standard Model prediction.",

The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the observed to the expected signal yield, is measured for each of these production processes as well as inclusively. The global signal strength measurement of 0.99\u00c2\u00b10.14 improves on the precision of the ATLAS measurement at s=7 and 8\u00c2\u00a0TeV by a factor of two. Measurements of gluon\u00e2\u0080\u0093gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion productions yield signal strengths compatible with the Standard Model prediction. Measurements of simplified template cross sections, designed to quantify the different Higgs boson production processes in specific regions of phase space, are reported.

Differential and double-differential measurements are performed for several variables related to the diphoton kinematics as well as the kinematics and multiplicity of the jets produced in association with a Higgs boson. These differential cross sections are sensitive to higher order QCD corrections and properties of the Higgs boson, such as its spin and CP quantum numbers. No significant deviations from a wide array of Standard Model predictions are observed. Finally, the strength and tensor structure of the Higgs boson interactions are investigated using an effective Lagrangian, which introduces additional CP-even and CP-odd interactions.

    "abstract": "Observables sensitive to the anomalous production of events containing hadronic jets and missing momentum in the plane transverse to the proton beams at the Large Hadron Collider are presented. The observables are defined as a ratio of cross sections, for events containing jets and large missing transverse momentum to events containing jets and a pair of charged leptons from the decay of a $Z/\\gamma ^*$ boson. This definition minimises experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties in the measurements. This ratio is measured differentially with respect to a number of kinematic properties of the hadronic system in two phase-space regions, one inclusive single-jet region and one region sensitive to vector-boson-fusion topologies. The data are found to be in agreement with the Standard Model predictions and used to constrain a variety of theoretical models for dark-matter production, including simplified models, effective field theory models, and invisible decays of the Higgs boson. The measurements use 3.2\u00c2\u00a0fb$^{-1}$ of proton\u00e2\u0080\u0093proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\u00c2\u00a0 $\\text {TeV}$ and are fully corrected for detector effects, meaning that the data can be used to constrain new-physics models beyond those shown in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The rejection of forward jets originating from additional proton\u00e2\u0080\u0093proton interactions (pile-up) is crucial for a variety of physics analyses at the LHC, including Standard Model measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. The identification of such jets is challenging due to the lack of track and vertex information in the pseudorapidity range $|\\eta |>2.5$ . This paper presents a novel strategy for forward pile-up jet tagging that exploits jet shapes and topological jet correlations in pile-up interactions. Measurements of the per-jet tagging efficiency are presented using a data set of 3.2\u00c2\u00a0fb$^{-1}$ of proton\u00e2\u0080\u0093proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 $\\,\\text {TeV}$ collected with the ATLAS detector. The fraction of pile-up jets rejected in the range $2.5<|\\eta |<4.5$ is estimated in simulated events with an average of 22 interactions per bunch-crossing. It increases with jet transverse momentum and, for jets with transverse momentum between 20 and 50 GeV, it ranges between 49% and 67% with an efficiency of 85% for selecting hard-scatter jets. A case study is performed in Higgs boson production via the vector-boson fusion process, showing that these techniques mitigate the background growth due to additional proton\u00e2\u0080\u0093proton interactions, thus enhancing the reach for such signatures.",

The analysis is based on proton--proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded in 2015. Two searches are performed, one targeted at a spin-2 particle of mass larger than 500 GeV, using Randall--Sundrum graviton states as a benchmark model, and one optimized for a spin-0 particle of mass larger than 200 GeV. Varying both the mass and the decay width, the most significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed at a diphoton invariant mass around 750 GeV with local significances of 3.8 and 3.9 standard deviations in the searches optimized for a spin-2 and spin-0 particle, respectively. The global significances are estimated to be 2.1 standard deviations for both analyses. The consistency between the data collected at 13 TeV and 8 TeV is also evaluated. Limits on the production cross section times branching ratio to two photons for the two  resonance types are reported.",

    "abstract": "Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a $W$ or a $Z$ boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes $H \\to ZZ, WW$, $\\gamma\\gamma, \\tau\\tau, bb$, and $\\mu\\mu$. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and 20 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.09 $\\pm$ 0.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the $H \\to \\tau\\tau$ decay of $5.4$ and $5.5$ standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.",

In the current study, the measured production and decay rates of the observed Higgs boson in the $\\gamma\\gamma$, $ZZ$, $WW$, $Z\\gamma$, $bb$, $\\tau\\tau$, and $\\mu\\mu$ decay channels, along with results from the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top-quark pair, are used to probe the scaling of the couplings with mass. Limits are set on parameters in extensions of the Standard Model including a composite Higgs boson, an additional electroweak singlet, and two-Higgs-doublet models. Together with the measured mass of the scalar Higgs boson in the $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $ZZ$ decay modes, a lower limit is set on the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass of $m_{A}>370$ GeV in the ``hMSSM'' simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.

Direct searches for invisible Higgs boson decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a Higgs boson with $W/Z$ ($Z\\to ll$, $W/Z \\to jj$) modes are statistically combined to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of 0.25.

The search uses 20.3 fb${}^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV data collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events are required to have at least one jet with $p_T > 120$ GeV and no leptons. Nine signal regions are considered with increasing missing transverse momentum requirements between $E_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{miss}} >150$ GeV and $E_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathrm{miss}} > 700$ GeV. Good agreement is observed between the number of events in data and Standard Model expectations. The results are translated into exclusion limits on models with large extra spatial dimensions, pair production of weakly interacting dark matter candidates, and production of very light gravitinos in a gauge-mediated supersymmetric model. In addition, limits on the production of an invisibly decaying Higgs-like boson leading to similar topologies in the final state are presented.",

The recently discovered Higgs boson is treated as a background. No significant evidence for an additional signal is observed. The results are presented as limits at the 95 % confidence level on the production cross-section of a scalar boson times branching ratio into two photons, in a fiducial volume where the reconstruction efficiency is approximately independent of the event topology.

The analysis is performed in the $H \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ decay channel using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

Four additional fiducial cross sections and two cross-section limits are presented in phase space regions that test the theoretical modelling of different Higgs boson production mechanisms, or are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Differential cross sections are also presented, as a function of variables related to the diphoton kinematics and the jet activity produced in the Higgs boson events. The observed spectra are statistically limited but broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.",

    "abstract": "Nearly 50 years ago, theoretical physicists proposed that a field permeates the universe and gives energy to the vacuum. This field was required to explain why some, but not all, fundamental particles have mass. Numerous precision measurements during recent decades have provided indirect support for the existence of this field, but one crucial prediction of this theory has remained unconfirmed despite 30 years of experimental searches: the existence of a massive particle, the standard model Higgs boson. The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN has now observed the production of a new particle with a mass of 126 giga\u00e2\u0080\u0093electron volts and decay signatures consistent with those expected for the Higgs particle. This result is strong support for the standard model of particle physics, including the presence of this vacuum field. The existence and properties of the newly discovered particle may also have consequences beyond the standard model itself.",

    "title": "Search for charged Higgs bosons through the violation of lepton universality in $t\\bar{t}$ events using pp collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV with the ATLAS experiment",
    "abstract": "In several extensions of the Standard Model, the top quark can decay into a bottom quark and a light charged Higgs boson $H^+, t \\to bH^+$, in addition to the Standard Model decay $t \\to bW$. Since W bosons decay to the three lepton generations equally, while $H^+$ may predominantly decay into $\\tau\\nu$, charged Higgs bosons can be searched for using the violation of lepton universality in top quark decays. The analysis in this paper is based on 4.6/fb of proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Signatures containing leptons (e or $\\mu$) and/or a hadronically decaying $\\tau (\\tau_{had})$ are used. Event yield ratios between $e+\\tau_{had}$ and $e+\\mu$, as well as between $\\mu+\\tau_{had}$ and $\\mu+e$, final states are measured in the data and compared to predictions from simulations. This ratio-based method reduces the impact of systematic uncertainties in the analysis. No significant deviation from the Standard Model predictions is observed. With the assumption that the branching fraction $B(H^+ \\to \\tau\\nu)$ is 100%, upper limits in the range 3.2%-4.4% can be placed on the branching fraction $B(t \\to bH^+)$ for charged Higgs boson masses $m_{H+}$ in the range 90-140 GeV. After combination with results from a search for charged Higgs bosons in ttbar decays using the $\\tau_{had}$+jets final state, upper limits on $B(t \\to bH^+)$ can be set in the range 0.8%-3.4%, for $m_{H+}$ in the range 90-160 GeV.",

The search is performed in a data sample corresponding to 1.6 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected in 2011 at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Muon pairs are selected by requiring two isolated muons of the same electric charge with pT > 20 GeV and abs(eta) < 2.5. Minimal requirements are placed on the rest of the event activity. The distribution of the invariant mass of the muon pair m(mumu) is found to agree well with the background expectation. Upper limits on the cross section for anomalous production of two muons with the same electric charge are placed as a function of m(mumu) within a fiducial region defined by the event selection.
