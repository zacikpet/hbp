Search for Higgs bosons produced via vector-boson fusion and decaying into bottom quark pairs in √(s) = 13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search for the bbÂ¯ decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson produced through vector-boson fusion is presented. Three mutually exclusive channels are considered: two all-hadronic channels and a photon-associated channel. Results are reported from the analysis of up to 30.6ââfb-1 of pp data at s=13ââTeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measured signal strength relative to the Standard Model prediction from the combined analysis is 2.5-1.3+1.4 for inclusive Higgs boson production and 3.0-1.6+1.7 for vector-boson fusion production only.
