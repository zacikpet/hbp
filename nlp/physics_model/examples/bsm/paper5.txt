Search for single production of a vector-like B quark decaying into a bottom quark and a Higgs boson which decays into a pair of photons. A search is presented for single production of a vector-like B quark that decays into a Higgs boson and a b quark. The search uses a dataset corresponding to 79.8 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV collected during 2015-2017 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis focuses on the presence of a Higgs boson that decays into two photons, a high-momentum b-jet and a forward jet, characteristic of t-channel production of the signal process. The main background process is non-resonant diphoton production, with additional small contributions from Standard Model processes containing H→γγ decays. No significant excess above the background expectation is observed, and upper limits on the signal production cross section are set as a function of the B-quark mass. Assuming a generalized coupling κ_B = 0.5 and doublet branching ratios of 50% for B→ Hb and B→ Zb, B quarks with masses less than 1210 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.
