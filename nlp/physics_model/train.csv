"Flavour independent search for Higgs bosons decaying into hadronic final states in e+e- collisions. A search for the Higgsstrahlung process e+e- -> hZ is described, where the neutral Higgs boson h is assumed to decay into hadronic final states. In order to be sensitive to a broad range of models, the search is performed independent of the flavour content of the Higgs boson decay. The analysis is based on e+e- collision data collected by the OPAL detector at energies between 192 GeV and 209 GeV. The search does not reveal any significant excess over the Standard Model background prediction. Results are combined with previous searches at energies around 91 GeV and at 189 GeV. A limit is set on the product of the cross-section and the hadronic branching ration of the Higgs boson, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. Assuming the hZ coupling predicted by the Standard Model, and a Higgs boson decaying only into hadronic final states, a lower bound of 104 GeV/c2 is set on the mass at the 95% confidence level.

"Search for doubly charged Higgs boson production in multi-lepton final states with the ATLAS detector using protonâproton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for doubly charged Higgs bosons with pairs of prompt, isolated, highly energetic leptons with the same electric charge is presented. The search uses a protonâproton collision data sample at a centre-of-mass energy of 13Â TeV corresponding to 36.1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This analysis focuses on the decays H^±±→ e^±e^± , H^±±→ e^±μ ^± and H^±±→μ ^±μ ^± , fitting the dilepton mass spectra in several exclusive signal regions. No significant evidence of a signal is observed and corresponding limits on the production cross-section and consequently a lower limit on m(H^±±) are derived at 95% confidence level. With ℓ ^±ℓ ^±=e^±e^±/μ ^±μ ^±/e^±μ ^± , the observed lower limit on the mass of a doubly charged Higgs boson only coupling to left-handed leptons varies from 770 to 870Â GeV (850Â GeV expected) for B(H^±±→ℓ ^±ℓ ^±)=100

"Search for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons in e^+e^-→ Z^0h^0 production at √(s) = 183 - 209 GeV. A search is performed for Higgs bosons decaying into invisible final states, produced in association with a Zo boson in e+e- collisions at energies between 183 and 209 GeV. The search is based on data samples collected by the OPAL detector at LEP corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 660 pb-1. The analysis aims to select events containing the hadronic decay products of the Zo boson and large missing momentum, as expected from Higgs boson decay into a pair of stable weakly interacting neutral particles, such as the lightest neutralino in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The same analysis is applied to a search for nearly invisible Higgs boson cascade decays into stable weakly interacting neutral particles. No excess over the expected background from Standard Model processes is observed. Limits on the production of invisibly decaying Higgs bosons produced in association with a Zo boson are derived. Assuming a branching ratio BR(ho->invisible)=1, a lower limit of 108.2 GeV is placed on the Higgs boson mass at the 95% confidence level. Limits on the production of nearly invisibly decaying Higgs bosons are also obtained.

"Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to τ^+ τ^- pairs in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying to pairs of tau leptons with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, recorded in 2010 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb^-1. After signal selection, 276 events are observed in this data sample. The observed number of events is consistent with the total expected background of 269 +/- 36 events. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are derived for the production cross section of a generic Higgs boson phi as a function of the Higgs boson mass and for A/H/h production in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as a function of the parameters m_A and tan(beta).

"Search for the charged Higgs boson in the etau and mutau dilepton channels of top quark pair decays. The large top quark production cross section at the Large Hadron Collider offers the opportunity to search for the charged Higgs boson as the decay t→ H^+b→τ^+ν b can be large in extensions of the standard model, if the mass is lighter than the top quark mass. A direct search for the charged Higgs boson in events with one lepton (electron or muon), at least two jets, missing transverse energy, and one hadronically decaying tau lepton has been performed in 36 pb^-1 of data collected in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. We do not find a signal in our search and derive an upper limit on the branching ratio BR(t→ H^+b)≃ 0.25-0.28 for masses between 80 and 140 GeV/c^2, when assuming BR(H^+→τ^+ν)=1.

A search for heavy resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the qq̅^(')bb̅ final state is described. The search uses 36.1 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13 collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations, with the largest excess found at a resonance mass of 3.0 TeV with a local (global) significance of 3.3 (2.2) σ.

"Measurement of inclusive and differential Higgs boson production cross sections in the diphoton decay channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. Measurements of the inclusive and differential production cross sections for the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel are performed using the data set of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^â1. The cross sections are measured in a fiducial phase space defined by a set of requirements on the isolation and kinematic variables of the photons. Differential cross sections are measured as functions of the kinematic properties of the diphoton system and the event. A subset of the measurements is performed in regions of the fiducial phase space, where relative contributions of specific Higgs boson production mechanisms are enhanced. The total cross section in the chosen fiducial phase space is measured to be 84 Â± 11 (stat) Â± 7 (syst) fb = 84 Â± 13 fb, to be compared with a theoretical prediction of 73 Â± 4 fb.

"Limits on the production of the Standard Model Higgs Boson in pp collisions at √(s) =7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) running at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is reported, based on a total integrated luminosity of up to 40 pb-1 collected by the ATLAS detector in 2010. Several Higgs boson decay channels: H →γγ, H → ZZ^(*)→ llll, H → ZZ → llνν, H → ZZ → llqq, H → WW^(*)→ lνlν and H → WW → lνqq (l is e, μ) are combined in a mass range from 110 GeV to 600 GeV. The highest sensitivity is achieved in the mass range between 160 GeV and 170 GeV, where the expected 95% CL exclusion sensitivity is at Higgs boson production cross sections 2.3 times the Standard Model prediction. Upper limits on the cross section for its production are determined. Models with a fourth generation of heavy leptons and quarks with Standard Model-like couplings to the Higgs boson are also investigated and are excluded for a Higgs boson mass in the range from 140 GeV to 185 GeV.

"Search for the Standard-Model Higgs boson decaying to tau pairs in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. A search for the standard-model Higgs boson decaying to τ pairs is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV respectively. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.4 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. The τ-pair invariant mass spectrum is studied in five different final states corresponding to the decay modes of the two τ leptons. An excess of events is observed over a broad range of Higgs mass hypotheses, with a maximum local significance of 2.93 standard deviations at m_ H= 120 GeV. The excess is compatible with the presence of a standard-model Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV.

The search is conducted by examining the reconstructed invariant or transverse mass distributions of Wh and Zh candidates for evidence of a localised excess.
