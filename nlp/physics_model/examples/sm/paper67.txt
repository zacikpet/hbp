Search for a Standard Model Higgs in the H->ZZ->llvv decay channel with 2.05 fb^-1 of ATLAS data. A search for a heavy Standard Model Higgs boson decaying via htollvv, where ℓ=e,μ, is presented. It is based on proton-proton collision data at √(s)=7, collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2011, that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb^-1. The data are found to be consistent with the background expected from other Standard Model processes and upper limits are placed on the Higgs boson production cross section over the entire mass range considered; in particular the production of a Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded in the region 310 GeV < m_mathrmH < 470 GeVat the 95% confidence level.
