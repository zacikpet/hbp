Search for nonresonant Higgs boson pair production in final states with two bottom quarks and two photons in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for nonresonant production of Higgs boson pairs via gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion in final states with two bottom quarks and two photons is presented. This search uses data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC from 2016 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. No signal is observed, and a 95
