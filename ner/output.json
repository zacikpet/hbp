First combined measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay using up to 139 fb^\u00e2\u0088\u00921 of proton\u00e2\u0080\u0093proton collision data at \u00e2\u0088\u009as = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment have recently been performed. This note presents two interpretations of these combined Higgs boson measurements. Measurements targeting Simplified Template Cross Sections in different decay channels are reparameterized in terms of the impact of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operators and constraints are reported on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. Measurements are furthermore interpreted in several MSSM benchmark scenarios, resulting in constraints on the MSSM parameters (m_A, tan \u00ce\u00b2) that are complementary to those obtained from direct searches for additional Higgs bosons. For all interpretations, no significant deviations from the Standard Model are observed.",

A search for resonant and non-resonant pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb\u0305\u03c4^+\u03c4^- final state is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collision data with \u221a(s)= 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The semileptonic and fully hadronic decays of the \u03c4-lepton pair are considered. No significant excess above the expected background is observed in the data. The cross-section times branching ratio for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is constrained to be less than 30.9 fb, 12.7 times the Standard Model expectation, at 95% confidence level. The data are also analyzed to probe resonant Higgs boson pair production, constraining a model with an extended Higgs sector based on two doublets and a Randall-Sundrum bulk graviton model. Upper limits are placed on the resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section times branching ratio, excluding resonances X in the mass range 305 GeV < m_X < 402 GeV in the simplified hMSSM minimal supersymmetric model for tan\u03b2=2 and excluding bulk Randall-Sundrum gravitons G_KK in the mass range 325 GeV < m_G_KK < 885 GeV for k/M_Pl = 1.",

The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have collected a total of 2461 pb-1 of e+e- collision data at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. The data are used to search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The search results of the four collaborations are combined and examined in a likelihood test for their consistency with two hypotheses: the background hypothesis and the signal plus background hypothesis. The corresponding confidences have been computed as functions of the hypothetical Higgs boson mass. A lower bound of 114.4 GeV/c2 is established, at the 95% confidence level, on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson. The LEP data are also used to set upper bounds on the HZZ coupling for various assumptions concerning the decay of the Higgs boson.",

In some extensions of the Standard Model, such as MCHM or NMSSM, the Higgs boson can couple to light CP-odd scalar particles. This document presents a study of a possible contribution to a Higgs boson signal in the H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 channel due to H\u2192 a a decays, where a is a light CP-odd scalar particle that decays predominantly into two photons before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter. Although this process yields four photon final states, we show that for a in the mass range of 100-400 MeV, the two photons from each a decay are often collimated so that they may be identified as a single photon. A large fraction of these events would contribute to an effective H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 signal. By following a selection similar to that of the H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 analysis, we set experimental limits for a generic class of Standard Model extensions having Higgs boson couplings to light scalar particles, assuming the a decays before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter.

A search for the production of a narrow-width resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons decaying into the bbZZ channel is presented. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector during 2016, in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The final states considered are the ones where one of the Z bosons decays into a pair of muons or electrons, and the other Z boson decays either to a pair of quarks or a pair of neutrinos. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the production of narrow-width spin-0 or spin-2 particles decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons, in models with and without an extended Higgs sector. For a resonance mass range between 260 and 1000 GeV, limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of a spin-0 and spin-2 resonance range from 0.1 to 5.0 pb and 0.1 to 3.6 pb, respectively. These results set limits in parameter space in bulk Randall-Sundrum radion, Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton, and N2HDM models. For specific choices of parameters the N2HDM can be excluded in a mass range between 360 and 620 GeV for a resonance decaying to two Higgs bosons.

A search for physics beyond the standard model in events with one or more high-momentum Higgs bosons, H, decaying to pairs of b quarks in association with missing transverse momentum is presented. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy \u221a(s) = 13 TeV. The analysis utilizes a new b quark tagging technique based on jet substructure to identify jets from H\u2192bb\u0305. Events are categorized by the multiplicity of H-tagged jets, jet mass, and the missing transverse momentum. No significant deviation from standard model expectations is observed. In the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), limits on the cross sections of pair-produced gluinos are set, assuming that gluinos decay to quark pairs, H (or Z), and the lightest SUSY particle, LSP, through an intermediate next-to-lightest SUSY particle, NLSP.

A search for a massive resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons, one of which decays to a pair of \u03c4 leptons and the other to a pair of bottom quarks, is presented. This analysis is based on the proton-proton collisions data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at CMS in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. For a high-mass (\u2273 1 TeV) resonance, the hadronization products of the bottom quarks coming from one of the two intermediate H bosons give rise to the presence of one single \u201cmerged\u201d jet, which can be identified through a study of its substructure consistent with the presence of bottom quarks. Due to the large boost of the intermediate H boson, the two tau leptons are similarly overlapping. Advanced techniques are used for their reconstruction and identification in events where one \u03c4 decays hadronically and the other one decays into an electron or a muon. Upper limits at 95",
