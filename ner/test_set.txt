Combined measurements of Higgs boson production and decay in the H→ ZZ^â→4ℓ and H→γγ channels using √(s)= 13 TeV pp collision data collected with the ATLAS experiment. Combined measurements of Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions are presented using the H→γγ and H→ ZZ^â→4ℓ decay channels, based on 36.1 fb^â1 of protonâproton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at √(s)= 13 TeV. Results are presented for the individual production processes of gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, WH, ZH, and tt̅H , and for kinematic subdivisions of these processes. The total cross section for pp → H + X is determined to be 57.0^+6.0_â5.9 (stat.) ^+4.0_â3.3 (syst.) pb, consistent with the Standard Model prediction of 55.6^+2.4_â3.4 pb. The results are translated into constraints on coefficients of Standard Model couplings. No significant deviations from the expectations are observed.
Evidence for the associated production of the Higgs boson and a top quark pair with the ATLAS detector. A search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (ttÂ¯H) is reported. The search is performed in multilepton final states using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1ââfb-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy s=13ââTeV at the Large Hadron Collider. Higgs boson decays to WW*, ÏÏ, and ZZ* are targeted. Seven final states, categorized by the number and flavor of charged-lepton candidates, are examined for the presence of the Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 125Â GeV and a pair of top quarks. An excess of events over the expected background from Standard Model processes is found with an observed significance of 4.1 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 2.8 standard deviations. The best fit for the ttÂ¯H production cross section is Ï(ttÂ¯H)=790-210+230ââfb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 507-50+35ââfb. The combination of this result with other ttÂ¯H searches from the ATLAS experiment using the Higgs boson decay modes to bbÂ¯, Î³Î³ and ZZ*â4â, has an observed significance of 4.2 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 3.8 standard deviations. This provides evidence for the ttÂ¯H production mode.
Search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons in the CMS detector. This note describes the search for a Higgs boson decaying into diphotons in the CMS detector. Data-driven methods are used to evaluate the reconstruction and selection performance for the signal, and the background is evaluated from a fit to the data. The analysis is performed on a dataset corresponding to 1.09 of data collected in 2011. Limits are set on the cross section of a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to 2 photons, and on the cross section of a fermiophobic Higgs boson decaying to 2 photons. The expected exclusion limit at 95 cross section between 110 and 135 , and the actual excluded ratio to the SM cross section varies between 1.9 and 7.4. For a fermiophobic model the expected exclusion limit at 95 the cross section predicted by the model between 110 and 114 .
Observation of the diphoton decay of the Higgs boson and measurement of its properties. Observation of the diphoton decay mode of the recently discovered Higgs boson and measurement of some of its properties are reported. The analysis uses the entire dataset collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions during the 2011 and 2012 LHC running periods. The data samples correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb^-1 at √(s) = 7 TeV and 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. A clear signal is observed in the diphoton channel at a mass close to 125 GeV with a local significance of 5.7 σ, where a significance of 5.2 σ is expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The mass is measured to be 124.70 ± 0.34 GeV = 124.70 ± 0.31 (stat) ± 0.15 (syst) GeV, and the best-fit signal strength relative to the standard model prediction is 1.14^+0.26_-0.23 =1.14 ± 0.21 (stat) ^+0.09_-0.05 (syst) ^+0.13_-0.09 (theo). Additional measurements include the signal strength modifiers associated with different production mechanisms, and hypothesis tests between spin-0 and spin-2 models.
Search for Higgs bosons decaying to aa in the μμττ final state in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS experiment. A search for the decay to a pair of new particles of either the 125Â GeV Higgs boson (h) or a second charge parity (CP)-even Higgs boson (H) is presented. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3ââfb-1 of pp collisions at s=8ââTeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The search was done in the context of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model, in which the new particles are the lightest neutral pseudoscalar Higgs bosons (a). One of the two a bosons is required to decay to two muons while the other is required to decay to two Ï leptons. No significant excess is observed above the expected backgrounds in the dimuon invariant mass range from 3.7 to 50Â GeV. Upper limits are placed on the production of hâaa relative to the standard model ggâh production, assuming no coupling of the a boson to quarks. The most stringent limit is placed at 3.5% for ma=3.75ââGeV. Upper limits are also placed on the production cross section of Hâaa from 2.33 to 0.72Â pb, for fixed ma=5ââGeV with mH ranging from 100 to 500Â GeV.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks in multilepton final states. A search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair is presented, using 19.6 fb^-1 of 8 TeV pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Final states with a Higgs boson that decays to either ZZ^*,WW^*, or ττ are required to have a top quark pair that decays to either lepton plus jets (tt̅→ℓνjjbb̅) or dileptons (tt̅→ℓνℓνbb̅), where ℓ represents an electron or a muon. The following signatures are selected: two isolated same-sign leptons (electrons or muons) plus b-tagged jets, three isolated leptons plus b-tagged jets, or four isolated leptons plus b-tagged jets. The expected 95 boson production cross section for a Higgs boson mass of 125.7 GeV/c^2 is 2.4 times the standard model expectation, to be compared to an observed limit of 6.6. The signal strength μ, relative to the expectation for the standard model Higgs boson, is measured to be μ =3.7^+1.6_-1.4.
Search for Charged Higgs bosons: Combined Results Using LEP data. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons in the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). The data of the four experiments are statistically combined. The results are interpreted within the 2HDM for Type I and Type II benchmark scenarios. No statistically significant excess has been observed when compared to the Standard Model background prediction, and the combined LEP data exclude large regions of the model parameter space. Charged Higgs bosons with mass below 80 GeV/c^2 (Type II scenario) or 72.5 GeV/c^2 (Type I scenario, for pseudo-scalar masses above 12 GeV/c^2) are excluded at the 95% confidence level.
Search for a spin-1 heavy resonance that decays to a Z boson and Higgs boson in the semileptonic final states with Run-2 data. This note describes the search for a heavy spin-1 resonance decaying into a Z boson and the 125-GeV Higgs boson, where the Z boson is identified through its leptonic decays (electrons, muons or neutrinos) and the Higgs boson is identified through its decay to quarks. The search is performed in the boosted regime for resonances with masses larger than 800 GeV. Model-independent upper limits are derived as a function of the resonance mass and natural width, and interpreted within the theoretical framework of the Heavy Vector Triplet model.
Search for Doubly Charged Higgs Bosons with the OPAL detector at LEP. A search for pair-produced doubly charged Higgs bosons has been performed using data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 614 pb-1 collected with the OPAL detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies between 189GeV and 209GeV. No evidence for a signal has been observed. A mass limit of 98.5GeV/c2 at the 95% confidence level has been set for the doubly charged Higgs particle in left-right symmetric models. This is the first search for doubly charged Higgs bosons at centre-of-mass energies larger than 91GeV.
Search for a light charged Higgs boson in the decay channel H^+ → cs̅ in tt̅ events using pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a charged Higgs boson (H^+) in tt̅ decays is presented, where one of the top quarks decays via t → H^+b, followed by H^+ → two jets (cs̅). The other top quark decays to Wb, where the W boson then decays into a lepton (e/μ) and a neutrino. The data were recorded in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2011, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb-1. With no observation of a signal, 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits are set on the decay branching ratio of top quarks to charged Higgs bosons varying between 5% and 1% for H^+ masses between 90 GeV and 150 GeV, assuming B(H^+ → cs̅)=100%.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H →τ^+ τ^- decay mode in √(s) = 7 TeV pp collisions with ATLAS. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons is reported. The analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^-1. No significant excess over the expected background is observed in the Higgs boson mass range of 100-150 GeV. The observed (expected) upper limits on the cross section times the branching ratio for H →τ^+ τ^- are found to be between 2.9 (3.4) and 11.7 (8.2) times the Standard Model prediction for this mass range.
Search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into four taus at LEP2. A search for the production and non-standard decay of a Higgs boson, h, into four taus through intermediate pseudoscalars, a, is conducted on 683 pb-1 of data collected by the ALEPH experiment at centre-of-mass energies from 183 to 209 GeV. No excess of events above background is observed, and exclusion limits are placed on the combined production cross section times branching ratio, ξ^2 = σ(e+e- –> Zh)/σ_SM(e+e- –> Zh) x B(h –> aa)x B(a –> τ^+τ^-)^2. For mh < 107 GeV/c2 and 4 < ma < 10 GeV/c2, ξ^2 > 1 is excluded at the 95% confidence level.
Search for Higgs boson off-shell production in proton-proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV and derivation of constraints on its total decay width. A search is presented for the Higgs boson off-shell production in gluon fusion and vector boson fusion processes with the Higgs boson decaying into a W ^+ W ^- pair and the W bosons decaying leptonically. The data observed in this analysis are used to constrain the Higgs boson total decay width. The analysis is based on the data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.9 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.4 fb^-1 at 8 TeV, respectively. An observed (expected) upper limit on the off-shell Higgs boson event yield normalised to the standard model prediction of 2.4 (6.2) is obtained at the 95% CL for the gluon fusion process and of 19.3 (34.4) for the vector boson fusion process. Observed and expected limits on the total width of 26 and 66 MeV are found, respectively, at the 95% confidence level (CL). These limits are combined with the previous result in the ZZ channel leading to observed and expected 95% CL upper limits on the width of 13 and 26 MeV, respectively.
Search for Charged Higgs Bosons in e^+ e^- Collisions at √(s)=189-202 GeV. A search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons was performed in the high energy data collected by the DELPHI detector at LEP II at centre-of-mass energies from 189 GeV to 202 GeV. The three different final states, τντν, c s̅c̅ s and c s̅τν were considered. New methods were applied to reject wrong hadronic jet pairings and for the tau identification, where a discriminator based on tau polarisation and polar angles was used. No excess of data compared to the expected Standard Model processes was observed and the existence of a charged Higgs boson with mass lower than 71.5 GeV/c^2 is excluded at the 95
Search for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the H → ZZ → l^+l^-νν̅ decay channel using 4.7 fb^-1 of √(s) = 7 TeV data with the ATLAS detector. A search for a heavy Standard Model Higgs boson decaying via H → ZZ → l^+l^-νν̅, where l represents electrons or muons, is presented. It is based on proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV, collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during 2011 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^-1. The data agree with the expected Standard Model backgrounds. Upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section are derived for Higgs boson masses between 200 GeV and 600 GeV and the production of a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range 319 - 558 GeV is excluded at the 95% confidence level.
Constraints on non-Standard Model Higgs boson interactions in an effective Lagrangian using differential cross sections measured in the H →γγ decay channel at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The strength and tensor structure of the Higgs boson's interactions are investigated within an effective field theory framework, which allows new CP-even and CP-odd interactions that can lead to changes in the kinematic properties of the Higgs boson and associated jet spectra. The parameters of the effective field theory are probed using a fit to five differential cross sections previously measured by the ATLAS experiment in the H →γγ decay channel with an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV. In order to perform a simultaneous fit to the five distributions, the statistical correlations between them are determined by re-analysing the H →γγ candidate events in the proton-proton collision data. No significant deviations from the Standard Model are observed and limits on the effective field theory parameters are derived. The statistical correlations are made publicly available to allow for future analysis of theories with non-Standard Model interactions.
Search for stop and higgsino production using diphoton Higgs boson decays. Results are presented of a search for a "natural" supersymmetry scenario with gauge mediated symmetry breaking. It is assumed that only the supersymmetric partners of the top-quark (stop) and the Higgs boson (higgsino) are accessible. Events are examined in which there are two photons forming a Higgs boson candidate, and at least two b-quark jets. In 19.7 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded in the CMS experiment, no evidence of a signal is found and lower limits at the 95% confidence level are set, excluding the stop mass below 360 to 410 GeV, depending on the higgsino mass.
Search for a charged Higgs boson decaying into top and bottom quarks in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV in events with electrons or muons. A search is presented for a charged Higgs boson heavier than the top quark, produced in association with a top quark, or with a top and a bottom quark, and decaying into a top-bottom quark-antiquark pair. The search is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Events are selected by the presence of a single isolated charged lepton (electron or muon) or an opposite-sign dilepton (electron or muon) pair, categorized according to the jet multiplicity and the number of jets identified as originating from b quarks. Multivariate analysis techniques are used to enhance the discrimination between signal and background in each category. The data are compatible with the standard model, and 95% confidence level upper limits of 9.6-0.01 pb are set on the charged Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to a top-bottom quark-antiquark pair, for charged Higgs boson mass hypotheses ranging from 200 GeV to 3 TeV. The upper limits are interpreted in different minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model.
Search for a very light CP-odd neutral Higgs boson of the MSSM.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a W or a Z boson and decaying to bottom quarks. A search for the standard model Higgs boson (H) decaying to bb̅ when produced in association with a weak vector boson (V) is reported for the following channels: W(μν)H, W(eν)H, W(τν)H, Z(μμ)H, Z(ee)H, and Z(νν)H. The search is performed in data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at √(s) = 7 TeV and up to 18.9 inverse femtobarns at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. An excess of events is observed above the expected background with a local significance of 2.1 standard deviations for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, consistent with the expectation from the production of the standard model Higgs boson. The signal strength corresponding to this excess, relative to that of the standard model Higgs boson, is 1.0 +/- 0.5.
Measurement of differential and integrated fiducial cross sections for Higgs boson production in the four-lepton decay channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. Differential and integrated fiducial cross sections for the production of four leptons via the H→ 4ℓ decays (ℓ = e, μ) are measured in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. Measurements are performed with data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb^-1 at 7 TeV, and 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV, collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Differential cross sections are determined as functions of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the four-lepton system, accompanying jet multiplicity, transverse momentum of the leading jet, and difference in rapidity between the Higgs boson candidate and the leading jet. A measurement of the Z→ 4ℓ cross section, and its ratio to the H→ 4ℓ cross section is also performed. All cross sections are measured within a fiducial phase space defined by the requirements on lepton kinematics and event topology. The integrated H→ 4ℓ fiducial cross section is measured to be 0.56^ +0.67_ -0.44(stat) ^ +0.21_ -0.06(syst) fb at 7 TeV, and 1.11^ +0.41_ -0.35(stat) ^ +0.14_ -0.10(syst) fb at 8 TeV. The measurements are found to be compatible with theoretical calculations based on the standard model.
Searches for Higgs bosons.
Constraints on the Higgs boson width from off-shell production and decay to Z-boson pairs. Constraints are presented on the total width of the recently discovered Higgs boson, Gamma_H, using its relative on-shell and off-shell production and decay rates to a pair of Z bosons, where one Z boson decays to an electron or muon pair, and the other to an electron, muon, or neutrino pair. The analysis is based on the data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 inverse-femtobarns at a centre-of-mass energy √(s) = 7 TeV and 19.7 inverse-femtobarns at √(s) = 8 TeV. A simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to the measured kinematic distributions near the resonance peak and above the Z-boson pair production threshold leads to an upper limit on the Higgs boson width of Γ_H less than 22 MeV at a 95% confidence level, which is 5.4 times the expected value in the standard model at the measured mass.
Flavour Independent Searches for Hadronically Decaying Neutral Higgs Bosons. This paper describes flavour independent searches for hadronically decaying neutral Higgs bosons in the data collected by the DELPHI experiment at LEP, at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. The collected data-set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of around 610 pb^-1. The e+e- -> hA and e+e- -> hZ processes are considered, with direct Higgs boson decays into hadrons. No evidence for Higgs boson production is found, and cross-section limits are set as a function of the Higgs boson masses. No explicit assumptions are made on the underlying physics beyond the Standard Model, allowing interpretation of the data in a large class of models.
Towards the Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in Vector Boson Fusion and decaying into a tau pair in CMS with 1 inverse femtobarn: tau identification studies. The Standard Model Higgs boson produced in vector boson fusion and decaying to a pair of τ leptons is an important channel in the search of the Higgs boson in the mass range between 115 and 145 GeV. A selection strategy for the ττ→ℓνν+τ-jet ν final state is presented. Some of the analysis methods that will be used to control the systematic uncertainties in the early searches at low luminosity of the order of 1 fb^-1 are also described.
Two Higgs Doublet Model and Model Independent Interpretation of Neutral Higgs Boson Searches. Searches for the neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0, are used to obtain limits on the Type II Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM(II)) with no CP-violation in the Higgs sector and no additional particles besides the five Higgs bosons. The analysis combines approximately 170 pb-1 of data collected with the OPAL detector at sqrts 189 GeV with previous runs at sqrts mZ and sqrts 183 GeV. The searches are sensitive to the h0, A0 -> qq, gg, tau+tau- and h0 -> A0A0 decay modes of the Higgs bosons. For the first time, the 2HDM(II) parameter space is explored in a detailed scan, and new flavour independent analyses are applied to examine regions in which the neutral Higgs bosons decay predominantly into light quarks or gluons. Model-independent limits are also given.
Measurement of inclusive and differential fiducial cross-sections of the Higgs boson in the H â ZZ* â 4 decay channel using 20.3 fbâ1 of pp collision data at sqrt(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Measurements of inclusive and differential fiducial cross-sections of the Higgs boson in the H -> ZZ* -> 4l decay channel are presented. The cross-sections are determined within a fiducial region of the ATLAS detector and corrected for detection efficiency and resolution effects. The differential measurements are performed in bins of the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the four-lepton system, the invariant mass of the two subleading leptons and the decay angle of the leading lepton pair in the four-lepton rest frame cosÎ¸â, as well as the number of jets and the transverse momentum of the leading jet. They are based on 20.3 fb-1 of pp collision data, produced at sâ=8 TeV center-of-mass energy at the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS detector. The comparisons of the unfolded fiducial cross-sections with several SM theory predictions are presented. No significant deviations with any of the tested predictions are found.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson in e^+ e^- collisions at √(s)=161, 170 and 172 GeV. The reaction e+e- -> HZ is used to search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The data sample consists of integrated luminosities of 10.9pb-1 1.1pb-1 and 9.5pb-1 collected by the ALEPH experiment at LEP during 1996, at centre-of-mass energies of 161, 170 and 172GeV, respectively. No candidate events were found, in agreement with the expected background of 0.84 events from all Standard Model processes. This search results in a 95%C.L. lower limit on the Higgs boson mass of 69.4GeV. When combined with earlier ALEPH searches performed at energies at and around the Z peak, this limit increases to 70.7GeV
2HDM Neutral Higgs Future Analysis Studies. The potential of future analyses to exclude or discover heavy, neutral Higgs bosons is analyzed in the context of models with two Higgs doublets. The production of a heavy scalar H boson and pseudo-scalar 𝒜 boson through gluon fusion, with subsequent decay H→ZZ→ 4ℓ (ℓ=e,μ) and 𝒜→Zh→ℓℓbb, is considered. The sensitivity of these analyses is assessed for a dataset consisting of ∫ Ldt=3000 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=14 TeV center of mass energy, collected with an average of 140 pileup interactions per bunch crossing.

Observation of an Excess of Events in the Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in the H→ WW^(∗)→ℓνℓν Channel with the ATLAS Detector. A Standard Model Higgs boson search in the H → WW^(*)→ eνμν decay mode has been performed using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.8 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected during 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search focuses on the mass region around 125 GeV, not previously excluded, where an excess of events over the expected background is observed corresponding to a local p_0-value of 6.0 × 10^-4, or 3.2 standard deviations. In a combined analysis of the 2012 data with the 4.7 fb^-1 of data acquired at √(s) = 7 TeV in 2011, the observed excess corresponds to a minimum local p_0 of 3 × 10^-3 or 2.8 standard deviations.
Search for Higgs boson production in association with a high-energy photon via vector-boson fusion with decay into bottom quark pairs at √(s)=13TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for the production of the Standard Model Higgs boson in association with a high-energy photon. With a focus on the vector-boson fusion process and the dominant Higgs boson decay into b-quark pairs, the search benefits from a large reduction of multijet background compared to more inclusive searches. Results are reported from the analysis of 132 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s)=13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measured Higgs boson signal yield in this final-state signature is 1.3 ± 1.0 times the Standard Model prediction. The observed significance of the Higgs boson signal above the background is 1.3 standard deviations, compared to an expected significance of 1.0 standard deviations.
Search for dark matter in events with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to two photons in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for dark matter particles in events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson candidate decaying to two photons is reported. The search uses 139fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC between the years 2015 and 2018. No significant excess of events is observed over the Standard Model predictions, and the results are interpreted extracting limits on three simplified models that include either vector or pseudo-scalar mediators and predict a final state with a pair of dark matter candidates and a Higgs boson subsequently decaying into a photon pair.
Search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to γγ or τ^+τ^- at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for dark matter particles is performed by looking for events with large transverse momentum imbalance and a recoiling Higgs boson decaying to either a pair of photons or a pair of Ï leptons. The search is based on proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected at the CERN LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^â1. No significant excess over the expected standard model background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are presented for the product of the production cross section and branching fraction in the context of two benchmark simplified models. For the Z^â²-two-Higgs-doublet model (where Z^â² is a new massive boson mediator) with an intermediate heavy pseudoscalar particle of mass m_A = 300 GeV and m_DM = 100 GeV, the Z^â² masses from 550 GeV to 1265 GeV are excluded. For a baryonic Z^â² model, with m_DM = 1 GeV, Z^â² masses up to 615 GeV are excluded. Results are also presented for the spin-independent cross section for the dark matter-nucleon interaction as a function of the mass of the dark matter particle. This is the first search for dark matter particles produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two Ï leptons.
Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel with 36.1 fb^â1 pp collision data at the center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Properties of the Higgs boson are measured in the two-photon final state using 36.1/fb of proton-proton collision data recorded at √(s)= 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The ATLAS and CMS mass measurement of 125.09 ± 0.24 GeV is used and signals are extracted in a diphoton mass range of 105-160 GeV. Production cross section measurements for a Higgs boson rapidity |y_H|< 2.5 and in the full phase space for gluon fusion (ggH), vector boson fusion (VBF), and Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson or a top-quark pair are reported. The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the observed signal yield to the expected signal yield, is measured for the same production processes as well as inclusively. The global signal strength measurement of 0.99 ± 0.14 improves on the precision of the previous ATLAS measurement by a factor of 2, and ggH (VBF) production is measured to be 1 σ below (2 σ above) the Standard Model expectation. Measurements of simplified template cross sections, designed to measure the different Higgs boson production processes in specific regions of phase space, are reported. The fiducial cross section is measured to be 54.7 ± 10.2 fb for a Higgs boson decaying to two isolated photons that have transverse momentum greater than 35% and 25% of the diphoton invariant mass and each with absolute pseudorapidity |η|<2.37, excluding the region 1.37 < |η|<1.52. Fiducial regions probing Higgs boson production in vector boson fusion or in association with large missing transverse energy, leptons or top-quark pair are reported. Finally, differential cross sections dominated by ggH production are measured as a function of diphoton kinematic variables sensitive to quantum chromodynamics and the spin of the Higgs boson. These are compared with state-of-the-art Standard Model predictions, where no significant deviations are observed.

A search for a doubly-charged Higgs boson, Φ^±±, in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb^-1 is presented. The search considers final states with three lepton final states coming from the associated production of Φ^±±Φ^∓ and the four lepton final states coming from the pair production of Φ^++Φ^–. Lower bounds on the doubly-charged Higgs boson mass are reported for a variety of assumptions on its branching ratio to charged lepton pairs.
Measurements of production cross sections of the Higgs boson in the four-lepton final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. Production cross sections of the Higgs boson are measured in the H→ZZ→4ℓ (ℓ = e, μ) decay channel. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1 is used. The signal strength modifier μ, defined as the ratio of the Higgs boson production rate in the 4ℓ channel to the standard model (SM) expectation, is measured to be μ= 0.94 ± 0.07 (stat) ^+0.09_-0.08 (syst) at a fixed value of m_H = 125.38 GeV. The signal strength modifiers for the individual Higgs boson production modes are also reported. The inclusive fiducial cross section for the H→4ℓ process is measured to be 2.84 ^+0.23_-0.22 (stat) ^+0.26_-0.21 (syst) fb, which is compatible with the SM prediction of 2.84 ± 0.15 fb for the same fiducial region. Differential cross sections as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the Higgs boson, the number of associated jets, and the transverse momentum of the leading associated jet are measured. A new set of cross section measurements in mutually exclusive categories targeted to identify production mechanisms and kinematical features of the events is presented. The results are in agreement with the SM predictions.
Search for a heavy pseudoscalar Higgs boson decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson and a Z boson in final states of two light leptons and two tau leptons at √(s)=13 TeV. A search is performed for a pseudoscalar Higgs boson, A, decaying into a standard model-like Higgs boson h and a Z boson. The standard model-like Higgs boson is specifically targeted in its decay into a pair of tau leptons, while the Z boson decays leptonically. A data sample of proton-proton collisions collected at √(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC is used, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. In the absence of observing the signal, model-independent and model-dependent limits are set. The model-dependent limits are set in two minimal supersymmetric standard model benchmark scenarios in the m_A-tanβ plane.
Search for additional heavy neutral Higgs and gauge bosons in the ditau final state produced in 36 fb^â1 of pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons and Zâ² bosons is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^â1 from proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015 and 2016. The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to Ï^+Ï^â with at least one tau lepton decaying to final states with hadrons and a neutrino. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2-2.25 TeV for Higgs bosons and 0.2-4.0 TeV for Zâ² bosons. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in benchmark scenarios. In the context of the hMSSM scenario, the data exclude tan Î² > 1.0 for m_A = 0.25 TeV and tan Î² > 42 for m_A = 1.5 TeV at the 95% confidence level. For the Sequential Standard Model, Z_SSM^â² with m_Zâ²â<â2.42 TeV is excluded at 95% confidence level, while Z_NU^â² with m_Zââ²â<â2.25 TeV is excluded for the non-universal G(221) model that exhibits enhanced couplings to third-generation fermions.
Combined search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A combined search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities from 4.6 fb^-1 to 4.9 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions collected at √(s) = 7 TeV in 2011. The Higgs boson mass ranges of 111.4 GeV to 116.6 GeV, 119.4 GeV to 122.1 GeV, and 129.2 GeV to 541 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level, while the range 120 GeV to 560 GeV is expected to be excluded in the absence of a signal. An excess of events is observed at Higgs boson mass hypotheses around 126 GeV with a local significance of 2.9 standard deviations (σ). The global probability for the background to produce an excess at least as significant anywhere in the entire explored Higgs boson mass range of 110-600 GeV is estimated to be 15%, corresponding to a significance of approximately one sigma.
Search for Higgs boson decays into pairs of light (pseudo)scalar particles in the γγ jj final state in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This Letter presents a search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson to a pair of new (pseudo)scalar particles, Hâaa , where the a particle has a mass in the range 20â60 GeV, and where one of the a bosons decays into a pair of photons and the other to a pair of gluons. The search is performed in event samples enhanced in vector-boson fusion Higgs boson production by requiring two jets with large invariant mass in addition to the Higgs boson candidate decay products. The analysis is based on the full dataset of pp collisions at s=13TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.7 fb â1 . The data are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions and an upper limit at the 95% confidence level is placed on the production cross section times the branching ratio for the decay HâaaâÎ³Î³gg . This limit ranges from 3.1 pb to 9.0 pb depending on the mass of the a boson.
Search for resonant and nonresonant Higgs boson pair production in the bblnulnu final state in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. Searches for resonant and nonresonant pair-produced Higgs bosons (HH) decaying respectively into ℓνℓν, through either W or Z bosons, and b b̅ are presented. The analyses are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within uncertainties. For the standard model HH hypothesis, the data exclude at 95% confidence level a product of the production cross section and branching fraction larger than 72 fb, corresponding to 79 times the prediction, consistent with expectations. Constraints are placed on different scenarios considering anomalous couplings, which could affect the rate and kinematics of HH production. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section of narrow-width spin-0 and spin-2 particles decaying to Higgs boson pairs, the latter produced with minimal gravity-like coupling.
Searches for exclusive Higgs and Z boson decays into J/ψγ, ψ(2S)γ, and Υ(nS)γ at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Searches for the exclusive decays of the Higgs and Z bosons into a J/Ï , Ï(2S) , or Ï(nS) ( n=1,2,3 ) meson and a photon are performed with a pp collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1fbâ1 collected at s=13TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess of events is observed above the expected backgrounds, and 95% confidence-level upper limits on the branching fractions of the Higgs boson decays to J/ÏÎ³ , Ï(2S)Î³ , and Ï(nS)Î³ of 3.5Ã10â4 , 2.0Ã10â3 , and (4.9,5.9,5.7)Ã10â4 , respectively, are obtained assuming Standard Model production. The corresponding 95% confidence-level upper limits for the branching fractions of the Z boson decays are 2.3Ã10â6 , 4.5Ã10â6 and (2.8,1.7,4.8)Ã10â6 , respectively.
Combined measurements of Higgs boson couplings in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. Combined measurements of the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson, as well as its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision data set recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 at √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 . The combination is based on analyses targeting the five main Higgs boson production mechanisms (gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson, or a top quark-antiquark pair) and the following decay modes: H→γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, bb, and μμ. Searches for invisible Higgs boson decays are also considered. The best-fit ratio of the signal yield to the standard model expectation is measured to be μ= 1.17 ± 0.10, assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV. Additional results are given for parametrizations with varying assumptions on the scaling behavior of the different production and decay modes, including generic ones based on ratios of cross sections and branching fractions or coupling modifiers. The results are compatible with the standard model predictions in all parametrizations considered. In addition, constraints are placed on various two Higgs doublet models.
Combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. This Letter describes a search for Higgs boson pair production using the combined results from four final states: bbγγ, bbττ, bbbb, and bbVV, where V represents a W or Z boson. The search is performed using data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment from LHC proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Limits are set on the Higgs boson pair production cross section. A 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limit on the nonresonant production cross section is set at 22.2 (12.8) times the standard model value. A search for narrow resonances decaying to Higgs boson pairs is also performed in the mass range 250-3000 GeV. No evidence for a signal is observed, and upper limits are set on the resonance production cross section.
Search for Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to Two Photons. A search for the associated production of dark matter with a Higgs boson which decays into two photons is presented. The search uses data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Results are interpreted in the context of two dark matter models: a two-Higgs-doublet-Z' model where the Z' decays to a pseudoscalar and a standard model-like Higgs Boson and a baryonic Z' simplified model. The search is performed categorizing the events based on the amount of missing transverse momentum in order to also be sensitive to hypothetical signals with small amounts of missing transverse momentum. After the final selection, no significant evidence for dark matter particle production has been observed. Two-Higgs-doublet-Z' signals with a pseudoscalar mass of 300 GeV are excluded at 95
Standard Model Higgs Boson with the L3 Experiment at LEP. Final results of the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson are presented for the data collected by the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies up to about 209 GeV. These data are compared with the expectations of Standard Model processes for Higgs boson masses up to 120 GeV. A lower limit on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson of 112.0 GeV is set at the 95% confidence level. The most significant high mass candidate is a Hnn bar event. It has a reconstructed Higgs mass of 115 GeV and it was recorded at Square root of s =206.4 GeV.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson Decaying to Bottom Quarks and Produced in Association with a W or a Z Boson. A search for the standard model Higgs boson is performed in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb^-1, recorded by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with a 7 TeV center-of-mass energy. The following modes are studied: W(μν)H, W(eν)H, Z(μμ)H, Z(ee)H and Z(νν)H, with the Higgs decaying to bb̅ pairs. 95
Search for vector-like quark pair production in final states with leptons and boosted Higgs bosons at √(s)=13 TeV. We present a search for pair-produced vector-like top partners (“T quark”) using data from pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of √(s)= 13 TeV that were recorded with the CMS detector in the 2015 data-taking period. The search is carried out in the lepton+jets channel and is most sensitive for final states in which at least one T quark decays to a top quark and a Higgs boson. Since the final decay products tend to be collimated in the detector, jet-substructure techniques are used to identify boosted Higgs boson decays to bb. No deviation from the Standard Model (SM) background prediction is observed in the data and upper 95
Search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson in the dimuon decay channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. The dimuon invariant mass spectrum is searched in the range between 5.5 and 14 GeV for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson "a", predicted in a number of new physics models, including the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model. The data sample used in the search corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.3 inverse femtobarns collected in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. No excess is observed above the background predictions and upper limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction sigma times B(pp to "a" to an oppositely charged muon pair) in the range of 1.5-7.5 pb. These results improve on existing bounds on the "a" b-bbar coupling for m("a") < m(Upsilon(1S)) and are the first significant limits for m("a") > m(Upsilon(1S)). Constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space are presented in the context of the next-to-minimal model.
Search for a standard-model-like Higgs boson with a mass in the range 145 to 1000 GeV at the LHC. A search for a standard-model-like Higgs boson in the H → WW and H → ZZ decay channels is reported, for Higgs boson masses in the range 145 < m_H < 1000 GeV. The search is based upon proton-proton collision data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at √(s) = 7 TeV and up to 5.3 inverse femtobarns at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The combined upper limits at 95% confidence level on products of the cross section and branching fractions exclude a standard-model-like Higgs boson in the range 145 < m_H < 710 GeV, thus extending the mass region excluded by CMS from 127-600 GeV up to 710 GeV.
Search for the standard model Higgs Boson in the decay channel H to ZZ to llqq at CMS. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to two Z bosons with subsequent decay to a final state with two leptons and two quark-jets, HZZℓ^-ℓ^+qq̅, is presented. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6 fb^-1 of LHC proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV were collected and analyzed by the CMS experiment. The selection to discriminate between signal and background events is based on kinematic and topological quantities, which include the angular spin correlations of the decay products. The events are classified according to probability of the jets to originate from quarks of light or heavy flavor or from gluons. No evidence for a Higgs boson is found and upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section are set in the range of masses between 226 GeV/c^2 and 600 GeV/c^2.
Search for Higgs boson production in association with top quark pairs in pp collisions. We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair in 5 fb^-1 of 7 TeV pp collision data. We look for events where the Higgs boson decays to bb̅ and the top quark pair decays to either lepton plus jets (tt̅→ℓν jjbb̅) or dileptons (tt̅→ℓνℓν bb̅), where ℓ is an electron or muon. The major background to our signal is top pair production. We use artificial neural networks to discriminate between background and signal events. We perform a simultaneous fit for signal and background fractions using the neural network output distributions. Our expected limit on Higgs boson production cross section times H → bb̅ branching ratio for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV/c^2 is 4.6 times the standard model expectation, while the observed limit is 3.8 times the standard model expectation.
Data-driven estimation of the background to charged Higgs boson searches using hadronically-decaying tau final states in ATLAS. The experimental observation of charged Higgs bosons, H^±, which are theoretically predicted by many non-minimal Higgs scenarios, would indicate new physics beyond the Standard Model. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, for example, the dominant production mode at the LHC for these Higgs bosons, when m_H^+ < m_t, takes place in tt events via the top-quark decay t→ H^+b with H^+→τν dominating for most values of tanβ. Two channels with a hadronically decaying τ coming from the charged Higgs boson are studied. The delivery of the first 37 pb^-1 of √(s)=7 TeV collision data allows many significant backgrounds to be estimated with data-driven methods, which represent the primary focus of this note and a crucial step towards ATLAS searches for the charged Higgs boson.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H- gt; tau^+ tau^- decay mode with 4.7 fb^-1 of ATLAS data at 7 TeV. A Higgs boson search in the H- gt; tau^+ tau^- decay mode has been performed using 4.7 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected during 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess is observed in the investigated mass range of 100-150 GeV. Upper limits on the cross-section times branching ratio are derived.
Search for the flavor-changing neutral current interactions of the top quark and the Higgs boson which decays into a pair of b quarks at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search for flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) in events with the top quark and the Higgs boson is presented. The Higgs boson decay to a pair of b quarks is considered. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^â1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. Two channels are considered: single top quark FCNC production in association with the Higgs boson (pp â tH), and top quark pair production with FCNC decay of the top quark (t â qH). Final states with one isolated lepton and at least three reconstructed jets, among which at least two are associated with b quarks, are studied. No significant deviation is observed from the predicted background. Observed (expected) upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the branching fractions of top quark decays, â¬(tââÂ uH)â<Â 0.47%Â (0.34%) and â¬(tÂ âÂ cH)â<Â 0.47%Â (0.44%), assuming a single nonzero FCNC coupling.
Measurements of Higgs boson properties from on-shell and off-shell production in the four-lepton final state. Studies of on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson production in the four-lepton final state are presented, using data from the CMS experiment at the LHC that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 80.2 fb^-1 at 13 TeV. Joint constraints are set on the width of the Higgs and parameters that express its anomalous couplings to two electroweak vector bosons using both on-shell and off-shell production of the Higgs boson. These results are combined with results from the data collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 fb^-1, respectively. Matrix element techniques, which combine kinematic information from the decay particles and the associated jets, are used to identify the production mechanism and to increase sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal and its anomalous couplings. The observations are consistent with expectations for a Standard Model Higgs boson. This document has been revised with respect to the version dated September 17, 2018.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson and decaying to a b-quark pair with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This note summarizes results on a first direct search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range 110 lt; mH lt; 130 GeV when produced in association with a W or Z boson and decaying to bÂ¯ b. No evidence for Higgs boson production is observed in a dataset of 7 TeV pp collisions corresponding to 0.83 fbâ1 and 0.67 fbâ1 of integrated luminosity, recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2011, for the associated Z and W channels respectively. Upper limits on Higgs-boson production cross-sections for the channels considered are presented and discussed.
Search for neutral Higgs bosons from supersymmetry in Z decays.
Constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons and fermions in production and decay in the H→4ℓ channel. Studies of CP-violation and anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to vector bosons and fermions are presented. Kinematics of the Higgs boson's four-lepton decay and of its production in association with a vector boson, hadronic jets, or a top-quark pair are used. The data used in this study were acquired by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1 at a center-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV. A full detector simulation of all kinematic effects in the Higgs boson decay and associated particle production is performed. These effects are analyzed using matrix element techniques to identify the production mechanism and to increase sensitivity to the Higgs boson couplings. Simultaneous measurement of up to five HVV, two Hgg, and two Htt couplings is performed. The results are presented in the framework of anomalous coupling measurements and are also interpreted in the effective field theory framework, with SU(2)×U(1) symmetry for the HVV couplings.
Combined measurements of Higgs boson production and decay using up to 80 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS experiment. Combined measurements of Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions are presented. The combination is based on the analyses of the Higgs boson decay modes H →γγ, ZZ^∗, WW^∗, ττ, bb̅, μμ, searches for decays into invisible final states, and on measurements of off-shell Higgs boson production. Up to 79.8 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at √(s)= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector are used. Results are presented for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes, and for associated production with vector bosons or top-quarks. The global signal strength is determined to be μ = 1.11^+0.09_-0.08. The combined measurement yields an observed (expected) significance for the vector-boson fusion production process of 6.5σ (5.3σ). Measurements in kinematic regions defined within the simplified template cross section framework are also shown. The results are interpreted in terms of modifiers applied to the Standard Model couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles, and are used to set exclusion limits on parameters in two-Higgs-doublet models and in the simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed.
Measurement of the Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks produced in association with a top-quark pair in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The associated production of a Higgs boson with a top-quark pair is measured in events characterised by the presence of one or two electrons or muons. The Higgs boson decay into a b-quark pair is considered. The analysed data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1, were collected in proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV. The measured signal strength, defined as the ratio of the measured signal yield to that predicted by the Standard Model, is 0.43^+0.36_-0.33. This result corresponds to an observed (expected) significance of 1.3 (3.0) standard deviations, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. For the first time, the signal strength is measured differentially in bins of the Higgs boson transverse momentum in the simplified template cross-section framework, including a boosted selection targeting Higgs boson transverse momentum above 300 GeV.
Search for a standard model-like Higgs boson in the mass range between 70 and 110 GeV in the diphoton final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 8 and 13 TeV. The results of a search for a standard model-like Higgs boson in the mass range between 70 and 110â¯GeV decaying into two photons are presented. The analysis uses the data set collected with the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions during the 2012 and 2016 LHC running periods. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 (35.9)fbâ1 at s=8 (13)â¯TeV. The expected and observed 95% confidence level upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction into two photons are presented. The observed upper limit for the 2012 (2016) data set ranges from 129 (161) fb to 31 (26) fb. The statistical combination of the results from the analyses of the two data sets in the common mass range between 80 and 110â¯GeV yields an upper limit on the product of the cross section and branching fraction, normalized to that for a standard model-like Higgs boson, ranging from 0.7 to 0.2, with two notable exceptions: one in the region around the Z boson peak, where the limit rises to 1.1, which may be due to the presence of DrellâYan dielectron production where electrons could be misidentified as isolated photons, and a second due to an observed excess with respect to the standard model prediction, which is maximal for a mass hypothesis of 95.3â¯GeV with a local (global) significance of 2.8 (1.3) standard deviations.
Search for low mass Higgs bosons produced in Z^0 decays.
Search for SUSY in Events with a Higgs Decaying to Two Photons Using the Razor Variables. A search for supersymmetry is carried out in proton-proton collisions with a center of mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 15.2/fb collected with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Events are selected by requiring one Higgs boson candidate decaying into two photons in association with at least one jet. Events are categorized according to the properties of the Higgs boson candidate(s) and the razor variables M_R and R^2 are used to improve discrimination between SUSY signals and the standard model backgrounds. The search is carried out by fitting the diphoton invariant mass distribution in each search region. The result of the search is interpreted in the context of a simplified model of bottom squark production and upper limits on the corresponding production cross section are derived.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into two Higgs bosons or into a Higgs and a vector boson in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. A search is presented for massive resonances decaying either into two Higgs (H) bosons or into a Higgs and a vector (V = W or Z) boson. The decay channels considered are VH→ qq̅τ^+τ^- and HH→ bb̅τ^+τ^-. This analysis is based on the data sample of proton-proton collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS Collaboration in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. For the high-mass resonances considered (≳ 1 TeV), substructure techniques are employed to differentiate between the hadronization products of a vector boson decaying to quarks, a Higgs boson decaying to bottom quarks, and quark- or gluon-induced jets. Due to the large boost of the Higgs boson, the two leptons in the H →τ^+τ^- decay are collimated. Advanced techniques are used for events in which one τ lepton decays hadronically and the other leptonically, and in which both decay hadronically. Upper limits at 95
A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to charm quarks. A direct search for the standard model Higgs boson, H, produced in association with a vector boson, V (W or Z), and decaying to a charm quark pair is presented. The search uses a data set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search is carried out in mutually exclusive channels targeting specific decays of the vector bosons: W→ℓν, Z→ℓℓ, and Z→νν, where ℓ is an electron or a muon. To fully exploit the topology of the H boson decay, two strategies are followed. In the first one, targeting lower vector boson transverse momentum, the H boson candidate is reconstructed via two resolved jets arising from the two charm quarks from the H boson decay. A second strategy identifies the case where the two charm quark jets from the H boson decay merge to form a single jet, which generally only occurs when the vector boson has higher transverse momentum. Both strategies make use of novel methods for charm jet identification, while jet substructure techniques are also exploited to suppress the background in the merged-jet topology. The two analyses are combined to yield a 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limit on the cross section σ(VH)ℬ(H→cc̅) of 4.5 (2.4^+1.0_-0.7) pb, corresponding to 70 (37) times the standard model prediction.
Search for a singly produced vector-like quark B decaying to a b quark and a Higgs boson in a fully hadronic final state using boosted topologies. A search is presented for the single production of a heavy vector-like quark (B) decaying to a Higgs boson and a bottom quark, B→Hb, with the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks. The decay products of the Higgs boson are highly boosted, hence typically collimated. They are reconstructed as a single, massive jet, with heavy flavour content. The single production of vector-like quarks is characterised by the presence of a light flavour quark emitted in the forward region of the detector. The analysis is performed using a data sample collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The observation is consistent with background expectation and upper limits are placed on the production cross section times the branching ratio of a vector-like quark B decaying to a Higgs boson and a bottom quark. Values of cross section times branching ratio above 0.07–1.28 pb are excluded at 95
Search for neutral and charged Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- collisions at √(s)= 161 GeV and 172 GeV. A search for neutral and charged Higgs bosons has been performed in the data collected by the DELPHI detector at centre-of-mass energies of 161 GeV and 172 GeV. The analysis assumes either the pair-production of charged Higgs bosons, H^±, or the production of the lightest neutral Higgs boson, h, with either a Z or a neutral pseudoscalar Higgs boson, A. All final state topologies expected from the decay of h and A %neutral Higgs particles into hadrons or a pair of τ leptons, and from the decay of H^± %charged Higgs bosons into a pair of quarks or a τν_τ pair have been considered. %In the case of the associated production with a Z boson, all decay %channels of the Z have been considered. %The case of a %Higgs boson decaying into invisible products has also been studied. %The results are interpreted %in the framework of the Standard Model and of its minimal supersymmetric %extension for the neutral Higgs bosons. %Results for the charged Higgs particles are deduced in the more %general two-doublet scheme. Lower limits at the 95
Search for decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson into a Z boson and a ρ or ϕ meson. Decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson into a Z boson and a ρ^0(770) or ϕ(1020) meson are searched for using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at √(s) = 13 TeV. The analysed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. Events are selected in which the Z boson decays into a pair of electrons or a pair of muons, and the ρ and ϕ mesons decay into pairs of pions and kaons, respectively. No significant excess above the background model is observed. As different polarization states are possible for the decay products of the Z boson and ρ or ϕ mesons, affecting the signal acceptance, scenarios in which the decays are longitudinally or transversely polarized are considered. Upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the Higgs boson branching fractions into Zρ and Zϕ are determined to be 1.04-1.31% and 0.31-0.40%, respectively, where the ranges reflect the considered polarization scenarios; these values are 740-940 and 730-950 times larger than the respective standard model expectations. These results constitute the first experimental limits on the two decay channels.
Search for exotic decays of a Higgs boson into undetectable particles and one or more photons. A search is presented for exotic decays of a Higgs boson into undetectable particles and one or two isolated photons in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 19.4 fb^-1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Higgs bosons produced in gluon-gluon fusion and in association with a Z boson are investigated, using models in which the Higgs boson decays into a gravitino and a neutralino or a pair of neutralinos, followed by the decay of the neutralino to a gravitino and a photon. The selected events are consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and limits are placed on the product of cross sections and branching fractions. Assuming a standard model Higgs boson production cross-section, a 95% confidence level upper limit is set on the branching fraction of a 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying into undetectable particles and one or two isolated photons as a function of the neutralino mass. For neutralino masses from 1 to 120 GeV an upper limit in the range of 7 to 13% is obtained. Further results are given as a function of the neutralino lifetime, and also for a range of Higgs boson masses.
Search for the neutral Higgs boson from Z^0 decay.
Constraints on the Higgs boson width from off-shell production and decay to ZZ to llll and llvv. We constrain the total Higgs boson width, Γ_H, using off-shell production and decay to four leptons, 4ℓ, or two leptons plus two neutrinos, 2ℓ 2ν, with ℓ = e,μ. The analysis is based on the data collected in 2012 by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity L = 19.7 fb^-1 at a center-of-mass energy √ s = 8 TeV. The 4ℓ analysis uses the ZZ invariant mass distribution as well as a matrix element likelihood discriminant to separate the ZZ components originating from gluon- and quark-initiated processes. The 2ℓ 2ν analysis relies on the transverse mass or missing transverse energy distributions in jet categories. An unbinned maximum-likelihood fit of the above distributions, combined with the 4ℓ measurement near the resonance peak, leads to an upper limit on the Higgs boson width of Γ_H < 4.2 ×Γ_H^SM at the 95 considerably improves over previous experimental constraints from the measurement near the resonance peak.
Observation of an excess of events in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H â ZZ(â) â 4l channel with the ATLAS detector.

An excess of events over back- ground is seen, with a minimum p0 value of 0.0021% (4.1 standard deviations) at mH = 123.5 GeV in the combined analysis of the two datasets. The fitted Higgs mass is measured to be mH = 123.5 Â± 0.9 (stat) Â± 0.3 (syst) GeV, and the signal strength (the ratio of the ob- served cross-section to the expected SM cross-section) at this mass is found to be Î¼ = 1.3+0.5. â0.4 A spin-parity analysis is performed on the events with 115 GeV < mH < 130 GeV. The 0+ state is found to be favoured over the 0â, 2+ and 2â states with 0â excluded by 2.7 Ï when compared to 0+.
Measurement of inclusive and differential fiducial cross sections for Higgs boson production in the H-to-4l decay channel in p-p collisions at 7 TeV and 8 TeV. Measurements of the inclusive and differential fiducial cross sections for Higgs boson production in p-p collisions at center-of-mass energies of √(s)=7 TeV and √(s)=8 TeV using H→ 4ℓ decays (ℓ = e, μ) are presented. Measurements are based on 5.1 fb^-1 (19.7 fb^-1) of 7(8) TeV proton-proton collision data, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. The measurements of differential cross section are performed in bins of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the four-lepton system, jet multiplicity, transverse momentum of the leading jet, and distance in rapidity between the Higgs boson candidate and the leading jet. A measurement of the cross section of Z boson production in the Z→ 4ℓ decay channel and its ratio to the Higgs boson production cross section in the H→ 4ℓ channel is also performed. The inclusive fiducial cross section for Higgs boson production in the H→ 4ℓ decay channel is measured to be 0.56^ +0.67_ -0.44 (stat.) ^ +0.21_ -0.06 (sys.) fb for proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV and 1.11^ +0.41_ -0.35 (stat.) ^ +0.14_ -0.10 (sys.) fb for proton-proton collisions at 8 TeV. The results of all measurements are compared with theoretical calculations based on the Standard Model and no significant deviation is observed.
Search for light pseudoscalar boson pairs produced from decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson in final states with two muons and two nearby tracks in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is presented for pairs of light pseudoscalar bosons, in the mass range from 4 to 15 GeV, produced from decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. The decay modes considered are final states that arise when one of the pseudoscalars decays to a pair of tau leptons, and the other one either into a pair of tau leptons or muons. The search is based on proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The 2μ2τ and 4τ channels are used in combination to constrain the product of the Higgs boson production cross section and the branching fraction into 4τ final state, σℬ, exploiting the linear dependence of the fermionic coupling strength of pseudoscalar bosons on the fermion mass. No significant excess is observed beyond the expectation from the standard model. The observed and expected upper limits at 95% confidence level on σℬ, relative to the standard model Higgs boson production cross section, are set respectively between 0.022 and 0.23 and between 0.027 and 0.19 in the mass range probed by the analysis.
Observation of an excess of events in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the gamma-gamma channel with the ATLAS detector. This note reports on a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and sqrt(s) = 8 TeV using integrated luminosities of 4.8 fb-1 and 5.9 fb-1, respectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search is performed for Higgs boson masses between 110 and 150 GeV. The expected exclusion limit at 95% confidence level varies between 0.8 and 1.6 times the Standard Model cross section over the studied mass range, and results in an expected exclusion range from 110 GeV to 139.5 GeV. The observed exclusion ranges for a Standard Model Higgs boson are found to be (112-122.5) GeV and (132-143) GeV at 95% confidence level. In between the two excluded regions, an excess of events is observed around the diphoton system invariant mass of about126.5with a local significance of4.5σ.
Searches for the standard Higgs boson.
Search for Doubly Charged Higgs Boson Production in Like-sign Muon Pairs in pp Collisions at âs=7 TeV. A search for doubly charged Higgs boson production at âs = 7 TeV is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.6 fbâ1 collected in 2011 by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed by selecting events with two high momentum muons that have the same electric charge, and by examining the invariant mass distribution of the dimuon pairs. No evidence for resonant production of such dimuon pairs is found, and the pair production cross section of doubly charged Higgs (HÂ±Â±) bosons times the HÂ±Â± â Î¼Â±Î¼Â± branching ratio is constrained to be less than 13 â 1.6 fb for HÂ±Â± masses between 100 and 400 GeV. For left-right symmetric models, and assuming the Drell-Yan production mechanism and a branching ratio of 100% to dimuon pairs, left-handed HÂ±Â± bosons are excluded at 95% confidence level for masses less than 375 GeV, while right-handed HÂ±Â± bosons are excluded below 295 GeV. Assuming a branching ratio of 33% to dimuon pairs, left-handed and right-handed HÂ±Â± bosons are excluded at 95% confidence level for masses less than 268 GeV and 210 GeV, respectively.
Search for H to bbbar in association with single top quarks as a test of Higgs couplings. A search for the production of the Higgs boson in association with a single top quark is performed using the decay H → b b̅. The rate for this Higgs production mode is particularly sensitive to the relative sign of the Higgs boson coupling to fermions and bosons. The full 2012 CMS dataset of pp collisions at a center of mass energy of 8 TeV is used. The analysis is optimized for a model with the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark y_t = -1, and an upper limit of 7.62 times the rate expected for this anomalous signal is observed, with an expected sensitivity of 5.22.
Measurement of fiducial differential cross sections of gluon-fusion production of Higgs bosons decaying to WW^∗→ eνμν with the ATLAS detector at √(s)=8 TeV. This paper describes a measurement of fiducial and differential cross sections of gluon-fusion Higgs boson production in the H→ WW^∗→ eνμν channel, using 20.3 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data. The data were produced at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 8 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2012.Â Cross sections are measured from the observed H→ WW^∗→ eνμν signal yield in categories distinguished by the number of associated jets. The total cross section is measured in a fiducial region defined by the kinematic properties of the charged leptons and neutrinos. Differential cross sections are reported as a function of the number of jets, the Higgs boson transverse momentum, the dilepton rapidity, and the transverse momentum of the leading jet.Â The jet-veto efficiency, or fraction of events with no jets above a given transverse momentum threshold, is also reported.Â All measurements are compared to QCD predictions from Monte Carlo generators and fixed-order calculations, and are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.
Search for Higgs bosons decaying to WW in e^+e^- collisions at LEP. A search for Higgs bosons produced in association with a fermion pair, and decaying to WW, is performed with the data collected by the ALEPH detector at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 191 to 209 GeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 453.2 pb^-1. Thirteen exclusive selections are developed according to the different final state topologies. No statistically significant evidence for a Higgs boson decaying into a WW pair has been found. An upper limit is derived, as a function of the Higgs boson mass, on the product of the e+e- ->Hff cross section and the H->WW branching ratio. The data on the search for H->WW are combined with previously published ALEPH results on the search for H->gamma gamma, to significantly extend the limits on the mass of a fermiophobic Higgs boson.
Search for SUSY Partners of Top and Higgs Using Diphoton Higgs Decays. We present results of a search for a “natural” SUSY scenario with gauge-mediated breaking. We select events in which there are two photons comprising a Higgs boson candidate, at least two b-jets and missing transverse energy. Using 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment we find no evidence of a signal and set lower limits at the 95
Search for Neutral Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs Bosons Decaying to Tau Pairs in pp Collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. A search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in pp collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 inverse picobarns recorded by the CMS experiment. The search uses decays of the Higgs bosons to tau pairs. No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. The resulting upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, yield stringent new bounds in the MSSM parameter space.
Measurement of the Higgs boson mass in the H→ ZZ^* → 4ℓ and H →γγ channels with √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions using the ATLAS detector. The mass of the Higgs boson is measured in the HâZZââ4â and in the HâÎ³Î³ decay channels with 36.1 fb â1 of protonâproton collision data from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. The measured value in the HâZZââ4â channel is mHZZâ=124.79Â±0.37GeV , while the measured value in the HâÎ³Î³ channel is mHÎ³Î³=124.93Â±0.40GeV . Combining these results with the ATLAS measurement based on 7 and 8 TeV protonâproton collision data yields a Higgs boson mass of mH=124.97Â±0.24GeV .
Combined Standard Model Higgs boson searches with up to 2.3 fb-1 of pp collisions at sqrts=7 TeV at the LHC. A combination of searches for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC is presented. The dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity per experiment ranging from 1.0 to 2.3 fb-1 of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The combination includes searches using the following Higgs boson decay signatures: H →γγ, H → bb, H →ττ, H → WW (lν lν) and H → ZZ (4l,2l2ν,2l2q,2l2τ). The SM Higgs boson masses tested in these searches range from 110 to 600 GeV/c^2. The expected exclusion region in the absence of a signal is 124-520 GeV/c^2. The observed data are compatible with the background only hypothesis and the SM Higgs boson is excluded at 95% C.L. or higher in the mass range 141-476 GeV/c^2. The region from 146 to 443 GeV/c^2 is excluded at the 99% C.L., with the exception of three small regions between 220 and 320 GeV/c^2.
Evidence for the direct decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson to fermions. The discovery of a new boson with a mass of approximately 125 GeV in 2012 at the LHC has heralded a new era in understanding the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking and possibly completing the standard model of particle physics. Since the first observation in decays to gamma-gamma, WW, and ZZ boson pairs, an extensive set of measurements of the mass and couplings to W and Z bosons, as well as multiple tests of the spin-parity quantum numbers, have revealed that the properties of the new boson are consistent with those of the long-sought agent responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. An important open question is whether the new particle also couples to fermions, and in particular to down-type fermions, since the current measurements mainly constrain the couplings to the up-type top quark. Determination of the couplings to down-type fermions requires direct measurement of the corresponding Higgs boson decays, as recently reported by the CMS experiment in the study of Higgs decays to bottom quarks and tau-leptons. In this paper we report the combination of these two channels which results, for the first time, in strong evidence for the direct coupling of the 125-GeV Higgs boson to down-type fermions, with an observed significance of 3.8 standard deviations, when 4.4 are expected.
Search for dark matter in association with a Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for dark matter pair production in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks is presented, using 3.2 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The decay of the Higgs boson is reconstructed as a high-momentum bb̅ system with either a pair of small-radius jets, or a single large-radius jet with substructure. The observed data are found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Results are interpreted using a simplified model with a Z' gauge boson mediating the interaction between dark matter and the Standard Model as well as a two-Higgs-doublet model containing an additional Z' boson which decays to a Standard Model Higgs boson and a new pseudoscalar Higgs boson, the latter decaying into a pair of dark matter particles.
Measurement of the Higgs boson mass from the H→γγ and H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ channels with the ATLAS detector using 25 fb^-1 of pp collision data. An improved measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson is derived from a combined fit to the invariant mass spectra of the decay channels H→γγ and H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ. The analysis uses the pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at center-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25 fb^-1. The measured value of the Higgs boson mass is m_H = 125.36 ± 0.37 (stat)± 0.18 (syst) GeV. This result is based on improved energy-scale calibrations for photons, electrons, and muons as well as other analysis improvements, and supersedes the previous result from ATLAS. Upper limits on the total width of the Higgs boson are derived from fits to the invariant mass spectra of the H→γγ and H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ decay channels.
Search for charged Higgs bosons with the H^±→τ^±ν_τ decay channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for charged Higgs bosons is presented in the H^±→τ^±ν_τ decay mode in hadronic and leptonic final states. The search is based on 35.9 fb^-1 of pp collision data recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The results agree with the expectation from the standard model. Upper limits at the 95
Search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bbℓνℓν final state with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production, as predicted by the Standard Model, is presented, where one of the Higgs bosons decays via the H→ bb channel and the other via one of the H → WW^*/ZZ^*/ττ channels. The analysis selection requires events to have at least two b-tagged jets and exactly two leptons (electrons or muons) with opposite electric charge in the final state. Candidate events consistent with Higgs boson pair production are selected using a multi-class neural network discriminant. The analysis uses 139 fb^-1 of pp collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. An observed (expected) upper limit of 1.2 (0.9^+0.4_-0.3) pb is set on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section at 95% confidence level, which is equivalent to 40 (29^+14_-9) times the value predicted in the Standard Model.
Search for Higgs bosons decaying into di-muon in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs bosons decaying into di-muon has been performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 13.2 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. Upper limits are set on the Higgs boson production cross section times the branching ratio as a function of the Higgs boson mass. No excess over non-Higgs Standard Model (SM) background is observed. The observed (expected) upper limit is 4.4 (5.5) times the SM prediction at the 95% CL for the Higgs mass m_H=125.09 GeV. When the data from the LHC Run 1 and Run 2 are combined, the observed (expected) upper limit is 3.5 (4.3) for m_H=125.09 GeV.
Search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons in two-doublet models.
Search for Higgs boson pair production in the WW^(*)WW^(*) decay channel using ATLAS data recorded at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for a pair of neutral, scalar bosons with each decaying into two W bosons is presented using 36.1 fb^â1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This search uses three production models: non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production and resonant production of a pair of heavy scalar particles. Three final states, classified by the number of leptons, are analysed: two same-sign leptons, three leptons, and four leptons. No significant excess over the expected Standard Model backgrounds is observed. An observed (expected) 95% confidence-level upper limit of 160 (120) times the Standard Model prediction of non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is set from a combined analysis of the three final states. Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio of a heavy scalar X decaying into a Higgs boson pair in the mass range of 260 GeV â¤ m_X â¤ 500 GeV and the observed (expected) limits range from 9.3 (10) pb to 2.8 (2.6) pb. Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio of a heavy scalar X decaying into a pair of heavy scalars S for mass ranges of 280 GeV â¤ m_X â¤ 340 GeV and 135 GeV â¤ m_S â¤ 165 GeV and the observed (expected) limits range from 2.5 (2.5) pb to 0.16 (0.17) pb.
Search for physics beyond the standard model in events with Higgs bosons and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for physics beyond the standard model in events with one or more high-momentum Higgs bosons H decaying to pairs of b quarks in association with missing transverse momentum is presented. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV. The analysis utilizes a new b quark tagging technique based on jet substructure to identify jets from H→ bb. Events are categorized by the multiplicity of H-tagged jets, jet mass, and the missing transverse momentum. No significant deviation from standard model expectations is observed. In the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), limits on the cross sections of pair-produced gluinos are set, assuming that gluinos decay to quark pairs, H (or Z), and the lightest SUSY particle LSP through an intermediate next-to-lightest SUSY particle NLSP. With large mass splitting between the NLSP and LSP, and 100
Search for a low mass neutral Higgs boson in Z0 decay.
Search for the pair production of Higgsinos in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV in final states with Higgs bosons and large missing transverse momentum. Results are reported from a search for new physics in proton-proton collisions leading to an experimental signature with two Higgs bosons and large missing momentum in the direction transverse to the beam axis. This signature can arise in the context of supersymmetry, where a broad class of models predicts the electroweak production of a pair of Higgsinos, each of which can decay via a cascade process to a final state with a Higgs boson and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The LSPs remain undetected, producing the large missing transverse momentum characteristic for these events. The search uses a 35.9 fb^-1 sample of proton-proton collision data at √(s)=13 TeV, accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The observed event yield in the signal region is found to be consistent with the expected standard model background predicted from control regions in the data. Higgsinos with mass in the range 225-770 GeV are excluded at 95
Search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bbτ^+τ^- final state. A search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bbτ^+τ^- final state is presented. The search is performed using three ττ final states, eτ_ h, μτ_ h, and τ_ hτ_ h, where e and μ indicate a τ lepton decaying to lighter leptons and τ_ h indicates a τ decaying into hadrons. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected in 2015 at 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb^-1.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks and decaying to bb̅ in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a pair of top quarks, tt̅H, is presented. The analysis uses 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s)=8 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2012. The search is designed for the H → bb̅ decay mode and uses events containing one or two electrons or muons. The Higgs boson is assumed to have a mass of 125 GeV. In order to improve the sensitivity of the search, events are categorised according to their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities. A multivariate technique is used to discriminate between signal and background events, which are dominated by tt̅+jets production. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found and an observed (expected) 95 % confidence-level limit of 4.1 (2.6) times the Standard Model cross section is obtained. By performing a fit allowing for an arbitrary Higgs boson signal strength, the ratio of the measured signal strength to the Standard Model expectation is found to be μ = 1.7 ± 1.4.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H → ZZ^(*)→ 4l with 40 pb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. This note presents the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the channel H → ZZ^(*)→ 4l using 40 pb ^-1 of pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2010. No candidate events are observed in the current data. Upper limits on the Standard Model Higgs production cross section are extracted as a function of the Higgs mass in the mass range 130 to 600 GeV. In addition, data-driven background estimation techniques are described and the results are found to be in agreement with the Monte Carlo predictions.
Search for 2HDM neutral Higgs bosons through the H→ZA→ℓ^+ℓ^-bb process in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. This note reports on a search for an extended scalar sector of the standard model, where a new CP-even (odd) scalar decays to a Z boson and a lighter CP-odd (even) scalar, which further decays to bb. The Z boson is reconstructed via its decays to leptons. The analysed data were recorded in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within uncertainties. Upper limits at 95
Search for invisible decays of Higgs bosons in the vector boson fusion production mode. A search for invisible decays of Higgs bosons in the vector boson fusion production mode is carried out using data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.2 fb^-1. Limits are set on the production cross section times invisible branching fraction, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. Assuming standard model Higgs boson cross sections and acceptances, the observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible branching fraction at m_H=125 GeV is found to be 0.57 (0.40) at 95
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced by vector-boson fusion in 8 TeV pp collisions and decaying to bottom quarks with the ATLAS detector. A search with the ATLAS detector is presented for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced by vector-boson fusion and decaying to a pair of bottom quarks, using 20.2 fb^-1 of LHC proton–proton collision data at √(s) = 8 TeV. The signal is searched for as a resonance in the invariant mass distribution of a pair of jets containing b-hadrons in vector-boson-fusion candidate events. The yield is measured to be -0.8 ± 2.3 times the Standard Model cross-section for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The upper limit on the cross-section times the branching ratio is found to be 4.4 times the Standard Model cross-section at the 95% confidence level, consistent with the expected limit value of 5.4 (5.7) in the background-only (Standard Model production) hypothesis.
Measurement of Higgs boson production and properties in the WW decay channel with leptonic final states. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W-boson pair at the LHC is reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 and 19.4 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The Higgs boson candidates are selected in events with two or three charged leptons. An excess of events above background is observed, consistent with the expectation from the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV. The probability to observe an excess equal or larger than the one seen, under the background-only hypothesis, corresponds to a significance of 4.3 standard deviations for m_H = 125.6 GeV. The observed signal cross section times the branching fraction to WW for m_H = 125.6 GeV is 0.72^+0.20_-0.18 times the standard model expectation. The spin-parity J_P=0^+ hypothesis is favored against a narrow resonance with J_P=2^+ or J_P=0^- that decays to a W-boson pair. This result provides strong evidence for a Higgs-like boson decaying to a W-boson pair.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson and decaying to a bb̅ pair in pp collisions at 13 TeV using the ATLAS detector. A search for the decay of a Standard Model Higgs boson into a bb̅ pair when produced in association with a W or Z boson has been performed with the ATLAS detector. Data were collected in proton-proton collisions from Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 13.2 fb^-1. Final states are considered that contain 0, 1 and 2 charged leptons (electrons or muons), targeting the decays: Z →νν, W →ℓν, and Z →ℓℓ. For m_H = 125 GeV the ratio of the measured signal strength to the SM expectation is found to be μ = 0.21 ^+0.36_-0.35(stat.)± 0.36 (syst.). This corresponds to an observed significance of 0.42 standard deviations compared with an expected sensitivity of 1.94. The analysis procedure has been validated by measuring the yield of (W/Z)Z with Z → bb̅, where the ratio of the observed yield to that expected in the Standard Model was found to be 0.91 ± 0.17 (stat.) ^+ 0.32_-0.27(syst.), corresponding to a significance of 3.0 standard deviations compared to an expected significance of 3.2.
Search for chargino and neutralino production in final states with a Higgs boson and missing transverse momentum at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is conducted for the electroweak pair production of a chargino and a neutralino pp →χ̃^±_1 χ̃^0_2, where the chargino decays into the lightest neutralino and a W boson, χ̃^±_1 →χ̃^0_1 W^±, while the neutralino decays into the lightest neutralino and a Standard Model-like 125 GeV Higgs boson, χ̃^0_2 →χ̃^0_1 h. Fully hadronic, semileptonic, diphoton, and multilepton (electrons, muons) final states with missing transverse momentum are considered in this search. Higgs bosons in the final state are identified by either two jets originating from bottom quarks (h → bb̅), two photons (h →γγ), or leptons from the decay modes h → WW, h → ZZ or h →ττ. The analysis is based on 36.1 fb^-1 of √(s) = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Observations are consistent with the Standard Model expectations, and 95% confidence-level limits of up to 680 GeV in χ̃^±_1/χ̃^0_2 mass are set in the context of a simplified supersymmetric model.
Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson decaying to a W boson pair in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. Measurements of the production of the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W boson pair are reported. The W+Wâ candidates are selected in events with an oppositely charged lepton pair, large missing transverse momentum, and various numbers of jets. To select Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion and associated production with a W or Z boson, events with two jets or three or four leptons are also selected. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fbâ1 , collected in pp collisions at s=13TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC during 2016. Combining all channels, the observed cross section times branching fraction is 1.28â0.17+0.18 times the standard model prediction for the Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09GeV . This is the first observation of the Higgs boson decay to W boson pairs by the CMS experiment.
Search for top-squark pairs decaying into Higgs or Z bosons in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for supersymmetry through the direct pair production of top squarks, with Higgs (H) or Z bosons in the decay chain, is performed using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC. The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 inverse-femtobarns. The search is performed using a selection of events containing leptons and bottom-quark jets. No evidence for a significant excess of events over the standard model background prediction is observed. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric models with pair production of a heavier top-squark mass eigenstate stop_2 decaying to a lighter top-squark mass eigenstate stop_1 via either stop_2 → H stop_1 or stop_2 → Z stop_1, followed in both cases by stop_1 → top neutralino, where the neutralino is an undetected, stable, lightest supersymmetric particle. The interpretation is performed in the region where the mass difference between the stop_2 and stop_1 states is approximately equal to the top-quark mass, m_(stop_2) - m_(stop_1) m_(top), which is not probed by searches for direct stop_1 squark pair production. The analysis excludes top squarks with masses m(stop_2) less than 575 GeV and m(stop_1) less than 400 GeV at a 95% confidence level.
Search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson to at least one photon and missing transverse momentum using 79.8 fb^-1 of proton–proton collisions collected at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Standard Model Higgs bosons decaying into at least one photon and missing transverse momentum is performed using 79.8 fb^-1 of protonâproton collisions collected at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector, where the photon can arise from a neutralino decaying into a gravitino. Higgs bosons produced in association with a Z boson are considered in order to reduce the number of background events. No excess with respect to the Standard Model prediction is observed. Assuming a Standard Model Zh production cross-section, the branching fraction of a Higgs boson to neutralinos or neutralino/gravitino is constrained to be less than 5â11% at the 95% confidence level for near massless gravitinos.
Search for the Higgs boson decays H → ee and H → eμ in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Searches for the Higgs boson decays H → ee and H → e μ are performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV at the LHC. No significant signals are observed, in agreement with the Standard Model expectation. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the branching fraction ℬ(H → ee) is 3.6 × 10^-4 (3.5 × 10^-4) and on ℬ(H → e μ) is 6.1× 10^-5 (5.8× 10^-5). These results represent improvements by factors of about five and six on the previous best limits on ℬ(H → ee) and ℬ(H → e μ) respectively.
Evidence for a new state decaying into two photons in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons is described. The analysis is performed using datasets recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV. The datasets correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 and 5.3 fb^-1, respectively. Limits are set on the cross section of the standard model Higgs boson decaying to two photons. An excess of events above the expected standard model background is observed for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 125 GeV, with a local significance of 4.1σ. The global significance of observing an excess with a local significance ≥4.1σ anywhere in the search range 110–150 GeV is estimated to be 3.2σ. This result constitutes evidence for the existence of a new state that decays into two photons.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to W^+ W^- in the fully leptonic final state in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to W+W- in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV is reported. The data are collected at the LHC with the CMS detector, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 inverse femtobarns. The W+W- candidates are selected in events with two charged leptons and large missing transverse energy. No significant excess of events above the standard model background expectations is observed, and upper limits on the Higgs boson production relative to the standard model Higgs expectation are derived. The standard model Higgs boson is excluded in the mass range 129-270 GeV at 95% confidence level.
Combination of searches for invisible Higgs boson decays with the ATLAS experiment. Many extensions of the Standard Model predict the production of dark matter particles at the LHC. Sufficiently light dark matter particles may be produced in decays of the Higgs boson H that would appear invisible to the detector. This document presents a statistical combination of searches for H→invisible decays where the H is produced according to the Standard Model via vector boson fusion or in association with a pair of top quarks in final states with zero or two leptons. These searches are performed with the ATLAS detector using 139 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 13 TeV at the LHC. In combination with the results at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, an upper limit on the H→invisible branching ratio of 0.11 (0.11^+0.04_-0.03) at 95
Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson in the four-lepton final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. Properties of the Higgs (H) boson are measured in the H→ Z Z→4ℓ (ℓ= e,μ) decay channel. The full data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137.1 fb^-1 recorded in 2016, 2017, and 2018 by the CMS detector at the LHC. The signal-strength modifier μ, defined as the ratio of the H boson rate in the 4ℓ channel to the Standard Model (SM) expectation, is measured to be μ=0.94^+0.07_-0.07( stat.) ^+0.08_-0.07( syst.) with the H boson mass profiled in the fit. The signal-strength modifiers for different H boson production modes are also constrained. Measurements of the simplified template cross sections, designed to quantify the different H boson production processes in specific regions of phase space, are reported. The cross section for the production of the H→4ℓ in a fiducial region closely matching the experimental selection of the leptons is measured to be σ_ fid.=2.73^+0.23_-0.22( stat.)^+0.24_-0.19( syst.) fb at m_ H = 125.09 GeV, compared to a SM prediction of 2.76 ± 0.14 fb. Differential cross sections as a function of the p_ T and rapidity of the H boson, the number of associated jets, and the p_ T of the leading associated jet are determined. All results are found to be compatible with the SM predictions, within the measurements precision.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying via H+ -> tau nu in ttbar events using 4.6 fbâ1 of pp collision data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The results of a search for charged Higgs bosons are presented. The analysis is based on 4.6/fb of proton-proton (pp) collision data at √(s)=7 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, using tt̅ events with a τ lepton in the final state. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. Assuming that the branching fraction B(H^±→τν) is 100%, this leads to upper limits on B(t → bH^+) between 5% and 1% for charged Higgs boson masses (m_H^+) ranging from 90 to 160 GeV, respectively. In the context of the m_h^max scenario of the MSSM, values of tanβ larger than 13-26 are excluded for charged Higgs boson masses in the range 90 < m_H^+ < 150.
Measurement of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a pair of top-antitop quarks with the Higgs boson decaying to two photons in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. This document reports the measurement of the rate of the associated production of a Higgs boson and a pair of top-antitop quarks (tt̅H), with the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of photons. Events with two photons are selected from a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2017, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.5 fb^-1. The tt̅H production is identified by requiring the presence of top quark decay products in the final state. The measured cross section, normalized to the standard model prediction, is 1.3^+0.7_-0.5. The combination with the published result using 35.9 fb^-1 of data recorded in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV is also reported. The combined best fit cross section, normalized to the standard model prediction, is found to be 1.7^+0.6_-0.5. All results are found in agreement with the standard model expectation.
Search for Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson decaying to bb̅ at √(s)= 13TeV with the ATLAS Detector using 79.8fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. A search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks is performed using pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)= 13TeV. The dataset has an integrated luminosity of 79.8fb^-1 and was recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Selected collision events comprise large missing transverse momentum and either two b-tagged small radius jets or a single large radius jet containing two b-tagged subjets. The reconstruction of these subjets is based on a jet algorithm that uses inner detector tracks as inputs and a radius parameter that decreases as the subjet transverse momentum increases. The observed data are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. The results are interpreted in the context of a simplified model (Z^'-2HDM) which describes the interaction of dark matter and Standard Model particles via new heavy mediator particles. Masses of the Z^' are excluded up to 2.8TeV depending on the choices for other model parameters.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in final states with leptons and b-jets in 36 fb^-1 of √(s) = 13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search is conducted for new resonances decaying into a W or Z boson and a 125 GeV Higgs boson in the νν̅bb̅, ℓ^±νbb̅, and ℓ^+ℓ^-bb̅ final states, where ℓ ^±= e^± or μ^±, in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. The data used correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during the 2015 and 2016 data-taking periods. The search is conducted by examining the reconstructed invariant or transverse mass distributions of Wh and Zh candidates for evidence of a localised excess in the mass range of 220 GeV up to 5 TeV. No significant excess is observed and the results are interpreted in terms of constraints on the production cross-section times branching fraction of heavy W^' and Z^' resonances in heavy-vector-triplet models and the CP-odd scalar boson A in two-Higgs-doublet models. Upper limits are placed at the 95 % confidence level and range between 9.0× 10^-4 pb and 8.1× 10^-1 pb depending on the model and mass of the resonance.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into bb̅ produced in association with top quarks decaying hadronically in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs boson production in association with a pair of top quarks (tt̅H) is performed, where the Higgs boson decays to bb̅, and both top quarks decay hadronically. The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search selects events with at least six energetic jets and uses a boosted decision tree algorithm to discriminate between signal and Standard Model background. The dominant multijet background is estimated using a dedicated data-driven technique. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an upper limit of 6.4 (5.4) times the Standard Model cross section is observed (expected) at 95% confidence level. The best-fit value for the signal strength is μ = 1.6 ± 2.6 times the Standard Model expectation for m_H = 125 GeV. Combining all tt̅H searches carried out by ATLAS at √(s)=8 and 7 TeV, an observed (expected) upper limit of 3.1 (1.4) times the Standard Model expectation is obtained at 95% confidence level, with a signal strength μ = 1.7 ± 0.8.
The status of searches for the Standard Model Higgs boson at LEP.
Measurement of the Higgs boson mass in the H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ and H→γγ channels with √(s)=13TeV pp collisions using the ATLAS detector. The mass of the Higgs boson is measured in the H → ZZ^* → 4ℓ and in the H→γγ decay channels with 36 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. The measured value in the H → ZZ^*→4ℓ channel is 124.88 ± 0.37 GeV, while the measured value of m_H in the H→γγ channel is 125.11 ± 0.42 GeV. The value of the Higgs boson mass obtained from a simultanous fit to the invariant mass distributions in the two channels is 124.98 ± 0.28 GeV.
Update of the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into WW in the vector boson fusion production channel. A search for the standard model Higgs boson in the vector boson fusion production channel is reported for Higgs boson decays via WW bosons in fully leptonic final states. The analysis uses pp collision data at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV from the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb^-1 and 19.5 fb^-1 recorded by the CMS detector in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Upper limits on the Higgs boson production relative to the standard model expectations are obtained for a Higgs boson in the mass range 110-600 GeV, yielding to an observed exclusion at the 95
Observation of vector-boson-fusion production of Higgs bosons in the H→ WW^∗→ eνμν decay channel in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. An observation of vector-boson-fusion (VBF) production of Higgs bosons in the H→ WW^∗→ eνμν decay channel is presented. The proton-proton collision data used to obtain this result were produced at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded with the ATLAS detector between 2015 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. The signal is observed (expected) with a significance of 7.0 (6.2) standard deviations. The product of the total VBF cross-section times the H→ WW^∗ branching fraction is measured to be 0.85 ± 0.10 (stat.) ^+0.17_-0.13 (syst.) pb, compatible with the Standard Model prediction of 0.81± 0.02 pb.
Search for the neutral Higgs bosons of the MSSM and other two-doublet models.
Higgs to gamma gamma, Fermiophobic. Search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 and 8 TeV in the diphoton decay mode is reported. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 fb^-1, recorded in 2011 at √(s)=7 TeV and of 5.3 fb^-1, recorded in 2012 at √(s)=8 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The Higgs boson mass range explored is 110–150 GeV. A fermiophobic Higgs boson is excluded at 95 in the mass range 110 –147 GeV. The fermiophobic hypothesis for the state found near 125 GeV is excluded at 99
Search for SM Higgs in WH to WWW to 3l 3nu. This document reports on a search for the associated WH Higgs boson production in the three lepton final state in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 Te -0.1em V. The analysis is performed using the LHC data recorded with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 10 fb^-1. Candidates are selected in events with three leptons, electrons or muons, large transverse missing energy and low hadronic activity. No significant excess of events above the standard model background expectation is observed. The observed (expected) upper limits on the WH cross section at the 95
Search for resonances decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons in the bb̅qq̅'ℓν final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for new massive particles decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented. Data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search is performed for resonances with a mass between 0.8 and 3.5 TeV using events in which one Higgs boson decays into a bottom quark pair and the other decays into two W bosons that subsequently decay into a lepton, a neutrino, and a quark pair. The Higgs boson decays are reconstructed with techniques that identify final state quarks as substructure within boosted jets. The data are consistent with standard model expectations. Exclusion limits are placed on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for generic spin-0 and spin-2 massive resonances. The results are interpreted in the context of radion and bulk graviton production in models with a warped extra spatial dimension. These are the best results to date from searches for an HH resonance decaying to this final state, and they are comparable to the results from searches in other channels for resonances with masses below 1.5 TeV.
Search for heavy resonances decaying to two Higgs bosons in final states containing four b quarks. A search is presented for narrow heavy resonances X decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons (H) in proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at √(s) = 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. The search considers HH resonances with masses between 1 and 3 TeV, having final states of two b quark pairs. Each Higgs boson is produced with large momentum, and the hadronization products of the pair of b quarks can usually be reconstructed as single large jets. The background from multijet and t t̅ events is significantly reduced by applying requirements related to the flavor of the jet, its mass, and its substructure. The signal would be identified as a peak on top of the dijet invariant mass spectrum of the remaining background events. No evidence is observed for such a signal. Upper limits obtained at 95% confidence level for the product of the production cross section and branching fraction σ( gg → X ) ℬ( X → HH → b b̅ b b̅) range from 10 to 1.5 fb for the mass of X from 1.15 to 2.0 TeV, significantly extending previous searches. For a warped extra dimension theory with a mass scale Λ_R = 1 TeV, the data exclude radion scalar masses between 1.15 and 1.55 TeV.
Missing mass spectra in hadronic events from e^+ e^- collisions at √(s)=161-172 GeV and limits on invisible Higgs decays. Events characterised by large hadronic energy and transverse momentum are selected from the data collected by the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies between 161 and 172 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 21 pb^-1. The visible mass and the missing mass distributions of the selected events are consistent with those expected from Standard Model processes. This result is combined with that from data taken at the Z resonance to set an upper limit on the production rate and decay into invisible final states of a non-minimal Higgs boson, as a function of the Higgs mass. Assuming the non-minimal Higgs production cross section to be the same as for the Standard Model Higgs boson and the decay branching fraction into invisible final states to be 100
Measurement of Higgs boson production in the decay channel with a pair of τ leptons. Measurements of Higgs boson production in the channel where the Higgs boson decays to τ leptons are performed. The analysis uses events recorded in proton-proton collisions by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, 2017, and 2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data sets correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. The product of the H→ττ signal production cross section and branching fraction is measured to be 0.85^+0.12_-0.11 times the standard model expectation. This analysis targets primarily the gluon fusion and the vector boson fusion production modes. Measurements of the signal strengths and products of the cross section and branching fraction are also performed in the simplified template cross section scheme, providing precise measurements of the Higgs boson production at high transverse momentum and in event topologies with jets. This document has been revised with respect to the version dated July 31, 2020.
Search for narrow high-mass resonances in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV decaying to Z and Higgs bosons. The first search for a narrow, high-mass resonance decaying into Z and Higgs (H) bosons is presented. The final state studied consists of a merged jet pair and a τ pair resulting from the decays of Z and H bosons, respectively. The analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected with the CMS experiment in 2012, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. In the resonance mass range of interest, the Z and H bosons are produced with large momenta, which implies that the final products of the two quarks or the two τ leptons must be detected within a small angular interval. From a combination of all possible decay modes of the τ leptons, production cross sections in a range between 0.9 and 27.8 fb are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the resonance mass.
Search for Lepton Flavour Violating Decays of the Higgs Boson. The first direct search for Lepton Flavor Violating Decays of the recently discovered Higgs boson using 19.7 fb^-1 of √(s)=8 TeV data taken in 2012 using the H →μτ_e and H →μτ_had channels is described , where τ_had and τ_e are taus reconstructed in the hadronic and electronic decay channels respectively. The sensitivity of the search is an order of magnitude better than the existing indirect limits. A slight excess of signal events with a significance of 2.5σ is observed. The local p-value of this excess at M_H=126 GeV is 0.007. Interpreted as a limit this results in a constraint of B(H →μτ )<1.57
Searches for neutral Higgs bosons in e^+e^- collisions at centre-of-mass energies from 192 to 202 GeV. Searches for neutral Higgs bosons are performed with the 237 pb^-1 of data collected in 1999 by the ALEPH detector at LEP, for centre-of-mass energies between 191.6 and 201.6 GeV. These searches apply to Higgs bosons within the context of the Standard Model and its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM) as well as to invisibly decaying Higgs bosons. No evidence of a signal is seen. A lower limit on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson of 107.7 GeV/c^2 at 95% confidence level is set. In the MSSM, lower limits of 91.2 and 91.6 GeV/c^2 are derived for the masses of the neutral Higgs bosons h and A, respectively. For a Higgs boson decaying invisibly and produced with the Standard Model cross section, masses below 106.4 GeV/c^2 are excluded.
Search for a non-standard-model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of new light bosons in four-muon final states. Results are reported from a search for non-standard-model Higgs boson decays to pairs of new light bosons, each of which decays into the oppositely charged dimuon final state. The new bosons may be produced either promptly or via a decay chain. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.3 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Such Higgs boson decays are predicted in several scenarios of new physics, including supersymmetric models with extended Higgs sectors or hidden valleys. Thus, the results of the search are relevant for establishing whether the new particle observed in Higgs boson searches at the LHC has the properties expected for a standard model Higgs boson. No excess of events is observed with respect to the yields expected from standard model processes. A model-independent upper limit of 0.78 +/- 0.05 fb on the product of the cross section times branching fraction times acceptance is obtained. The results are applicable to a broad spectrum of models and are also compared with the predictions of two benchmark scenarios as functions of a Higgs boson mass within the range 86-150 GeV and of a new light boson mass within the range 0.25-3.55 GeV.
Search for the Associated Higgs Boson Production in the WHâ WWW(â)â lÎ½lÎ½lÎ½ Decay Mode Using 4.7 fbâ1of Data Collected with the ATLAS Detector at âs = 7 TeV. A search for the Higgs boson in the associated production mode WHâ WWW(â)â lÎ½lÎ½lÎ½ (l = e, Î¼) has been performed using 4.7 fbâ1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector. No excess above background is observed. Within the mass range 110 GeV â¤ mH â¤ 300 GeV 95% CL limits are set from 2.7 to 43 times the Standard Model prediction, with the best limit being set at mH=165 GeV.
Search for a Higgs boson decaying into gamma*gamma to mu+mu-gamma with dilepton mass below 20 GeV in pp collisions at sqrt-s = 8 TeV. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons, one of which has an internal conversion into a muon pair, is described. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The events, collected at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. Events are selected which have an opposite-sign muon pair and a high transverse momentum photon. No excess above background has been found in the 120–150 GeV mass range and the first limits have been derived for the Higgs boson production cross section times the H→γ^*γ→μμγ branching fraction for dimuon invariant mass less than 20 GeV. The observed limit for a Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV is about ten times the standard model cross section times branching fraction.
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons at LEP. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for the neutral Higgs bosons which are predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The data of the four collaborations are statistically combined and examined for their consistency with the background hypothesis and with a possible Higgs boson signal. The combined LEP data show no significant excess of events which would indicate the production of Higgs bosons. The search results are used to set upper bounds on the cross-sections of various Higgs-like event topologies. The results are interpreted within the MSSM in a number of “benchmark" models, including CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. These interpretations lead in all cases to large exclusions in the MSSM parameter space. Absolute limits are set on the parameter tanb and, in some scenarios, on the masses of neutral Higgs bosons.
Search for charged Higgs bosons through the violation of lepton universality in tt̅ events using pp collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS experiment. In several extensions of the Standard Model, the top quark can decay into a bottom quark and a light charged Higgs boson H^+, t → bH^+, in addition to the Standard Model decay t → bW. Since W bosons decay to the three lepton generations equally, while H^+ may predominantly decay into τν, charged Higgs bosons can be searched for using the violation of lepton universality in top quark decays. The analysis in this paper is based on 4.6/fb of proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Signatures containing leptons (e or μ) and/or a hadronically decaying τ (τ_had) are used. Event yield ratios between e+τ_had and e+μ, as well as between μ+τ_had and μ+e, final states are measured in the data and compared to predictions from simulations. This ratio-based method reduces the impact of systematic uncertainties in the analysis. No significant deviation from the Standard Model predictions is observed. With the assumption that the branching fraction B(H^+ →τν) is 100%, upper limits in the range 3.2%-4.4% can be placed on the branching fraction B(t → bH^+) for charged Higgs boson masses m_H+ in the range 90-140 GeV. After combination with results from a search for charged Higgs bosons in ttbar decays using the τ_had+jets final state, upper limits on B(t → bH^+) can be set in the range 0.8%-3.4%, for m_H+ in the range 90-160 GeV.
Combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. This document describes the combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV performed by the CMS Collaboration using an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected at the LHC in 2016. Four different final states are considered, with one Higgs boson decaying into a bb̅ pair and the other decaying into γγ, ττ, bb̅, or a pair of vector bosons.

Search for a heavy Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W bosons in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for a heavy Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W bosons in the mass range from 200 GeV to 3 TeV is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 at √(s)=13 TeV. The decay of the W boson pair is reconstructed in the ℓνℓ ' ν ' and ℓν qq̅ final states. Both gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production of the signal are considered, with a number of hypotheses for their relative contribution investigated. Interference effects between the signal and background are also taken into account. Dedicated event categorizations based on the kinematic properties of associated jets and matrix element techniques are employed to optimise the signal sensitivity. The observed data are consistent with the standard model expectation. Combined upper limits at the 95

Search for Higgs boson production in association with top quarks in multilepton final states at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for the production for a standard model Higgs boson in association with a top quark pair (ttH) is presented. The analysis is based on pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a center of mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. We target final states where the Higgs boson decays to WW^*, ZZ^* or ττ, and at least one of the top quarks decays leptonically, by selecting events with two leptons of the same charge, three leptons or at least four leptons, and b-jets. We obtain a best fit ttH yield of 1.5 ± 0.5 times the standard model prediction, with an observed (expected) significance of 3.3σ (2.5σ), by the combination of these results with those obtained from the 2015 dataset.

Searches for both resonant and non-resonant production of pairs of Higgs bosons (hh) are performed in the bb̅γγ final state using 3.2 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at √(s)=13 recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. An upper limit of 3.9 pb on the cross-section for non-resonant production is extracted at the 95
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel with 4.9 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s)=7 TeV with ATLAS. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson is performed in the diphoton decay channel. The data used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb-1 collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. In the diphoton mass range 110-150 GeV, the largest excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is observed at 126.5 GeV, with a local significance of 2.8 standard deviations. Taking the look-elsewhere effect into account in the range 110-150 GeV, this significance becomes 1.5 standard deviations. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass ranges of 113-115 GeV and 134.5-136 GeV.
Measurement of the associated production of a Higgs boson decaying to b quarks with a vector boson at high transverse momentum in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The associated production of a Higgs boson with a W or Z boson decaying to leptons and where the Higgs boson decays to a bb Ì pair is measured in the high transverse momentum regime, above 250 GeV, with the ATLAS detector. The analysed data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fbâ1, were collected in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of âs = 13 TeV. The measured signal strength, defined as the ratio of the measured signal yield to that predicted by the Standard Model, is 0.72+0.39â0.36 corresponding to an observed (expected) significance of 2.1 (2.7) standard deviations. Fiducial cross-sections are measured in two ranges of gauge boson transverse momentum, 250â 400 GeV and above 400 GeV, according to region definitions of the simplified template cross-section framework.
Search for a Higgs boson in the mass range from 145 to 1000 GeV decaying to a pair of W or Z bosons. A search for a heavy Higgs boson in the H → WW and H → ZZ decay channels is reported. The search is based upon proton-proton collision data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 5.1 fb^-1 at √(s) = 7 TeV and up to 19.7 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Several final states of the H → WW and H → ZZ decays are analyzed. The combined upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction exclude a Higgs boson with standard model-like couplings and decays in the m_H range from 145 to 1000 GeV. We also interpret the results in the context of an electroweak singlet extension of the standard model.
Search for Charged Higgs bosons: Combined Results Using LEP data. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons in the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). The data of the four experiments are statistically combined. The results are interpreted within the 2HDM for Type I and Type II benchmark scenarios. No statistically significant excess has been observed when compared to the Standard Model background prediction, and the combined LEP data exclude large regions of the model parameter space. Charged Higgs bosons with mass below 80 GeV/c^2 (Type II scenario) or 72.5 GeV/c^2 (Type I scenario, for pseudo-scalar masses above 12 GeV/c^2) are excluded at the 95% confidence level.
Precise determination of the mass of the Higgs boson and studies of the compatibility of its couplings with the standard model. Properties of the Higgs boson with mass near 125 GeV are measured in proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC. A comprehensive set of production and decay measurements are combined. The decays to γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, and bb pairs are exploited, including studies targeting Higgs bosons produced in association with a pair of top quarks. The data samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and up to 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV; the final detector calibration and alignment are used in the event reconstruction. From the high-resolution γγ and ZZ channels, the mass of this Higgs boson is measured to be 125.03 ^+0.26_-0.27 (stat.) ^+0.13_-0.15 (syst.) GeV, with the precision dominated by the statistical uncertainty. For this mass, the event yields obtained in the different analyses tagging specific decay modes and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The combined best-fit signal strength, relative to the standard model expectation, is found to be 1.00 ±0.09 (stat.) ^+0.08_-0.07 (theo.) ±0.07 (syst.) at the measured mass. Various searches for deviations in the magnitudes of the Higgs boson scalar couplings from those predicted for the standard model are performed. No significant deviations are found.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion and decaying to bb̅. A first search is reported for a standard model Higgs boson (H) that is produced through vector boson fusion and decays to a bottom-quark pair. Two data samples, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.8 fb^-1 and 18.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV were selected for this channel at the CERN LHC. The observed significance in these data samples for a H → bb̅ signal at a mass of 125 GeV is 2.2 standard deviations, whilst the expected significance is 0.8 standard deviations. The fitted signal strength μ=σ/σ_SM= 2.8 ^+1.6_-1.4. The combination of this result with other CMS searches for the Higgs boson decaying to a b-quark pair, yields a signal strength of 1.0 ± 0.4, corresponding to a signal significance of 2.6 standard deviations for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.
Search for a heavy Standard Model Higgs boson in the channel H → ZZ → l^+ l^-qq using the ATLAS detector. A search for a heavy Standard Model Higgs boson decaying via H->ZZ->llqq, where l=e,mu, is presented. The search is performed using a data set of pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.04 fb^-1 collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC collider. No significant excess of events above the estimated background is found. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the production cross section (relative to that expected from the Standard Model) of a Higgs boson with a mass in the range between 200 and 600 GeV are derived. Within this mass range, there is at present insufficient sensitivity to exclude a Standard Model Higgs boson. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 360 GeV, where the sensitivity is maximal, the observed and expected cross section upper limits are factors of 1.7 and 2.7, respectively, larger than the Standard Model prediction.
Search for a high-mass Higgs boson decaying to a W boson pair in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a high-mass Higgs boson H is performed in the H→ WW→ℓνℓν and H→ WW→ℓνqq decay channels using pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 collected at √(s)= 8 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of a high-mass Higgs boson is found. Limits on σ_H×BR(H→ WW) as a function of the Higgs boson mass m_H are determined in three different scenarios: one in which the heavy Higgs boson has a narrow width compared to the experimental resolution, one for a width increasing with the boson mass and modeled by the complex-pole scheme following the same behavior as in the Standard Model, and one for intermediate widths. The upper range of the search is m_H=1500 GeV for the narrow-width scenario and m_H=1000 GeV for the other two scenarios. The lower edge of the search range is 200–300 GeV and depends on the analysis channel and search scenario. For each signal interpretation, individual and combined limits from the two WW decay channels are presented. At m_H = 1500 GeV, the highest-mass point tested, σ_H×BR(H→ WW) for a narrow-width Higgs boson is constrained to be less than 21 fb and 6.0 fb at 95% CL for the gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion production modes, respectively.
Search for Charged Higgs Bosons in e^+e^- Collisions at √(s) = 189 GeV. A search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons is performed with the L3 detector at LEP using data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 188.6 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 176.4 pb^-1. Higgs decays into a charm and a strange quark or into a tau lepton and its associated neutrino are considered. The observed events are consistent with the expectations from Standard Model background processes. A lower limit of 65.5 GeV on the charged Higgs mass is derived at 95
Combined Higgs boson production and decay measurements with up to 137 fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at sqrts = 13 TeV. Combined measurements of the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson, its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, and interpretations in the effective field theory framework are presented. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision data set recorded with the CMS detector at √(s)=13 TeV in 2016, 2017, and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 137 fb^-1, depending on the decay channel. All results are found to be compatible with the standard model expectation within the current uncertainties.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in Z^0 Decays.
Search for the neutral Higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model from Z0 decays.
Search for dark matter in association with a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV with the CMS detector. A search for the dark matter is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of bottom quarks in a data sample of proton-proton interactions at the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2015. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb^-1. Results are interpreted in the framework of the Type-2 two-Higgs-doublet model where a high-mass resonance Z^' decays into a pseudoscalar A_0 and the standard model Higgs boson. A_0 further decays into a pair of dark matter particles. The recoil of the Higgs boson against the dark matter particles is dependent on the mass of the resonance m_Z^', therefore, the Higgs boson is reconstructed using a pair of small-radius jets for low transverse momentum and a large-radius jet for high transverse momentum.
Updated measurements of the Higgs boson at 125 GeV in the two photon decay channel. Results are reported from a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the two photon channel in the mass range 110 < m_H < 150 GeV, using the full dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The most sensitive, MVA, analysis observes an excess of events at a mass of 125 GeV, with a local significance of 3.2σ (standard deviations), where a local significance of 4.2σ is expected from a standard model Higgs boson. The best-fit signal strength, σ/σ_SM, is 0.78± 0.27 at m_H = 125 GeV, and the mass is fitted to be 125.4 ± 0.5(stat.) ± 0.6(syst.). The cut-based analysis observes a corresponding excess with a local significance of 3.9σ (3.5σ expected), and σ/σ_SM = 1.11 ± 0.31 at m_H = 124.5 GeV. All measurements are compatible among themselves and with a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.4 GeV.
Inclusive search for highly boosted Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for standard model Higgs bosons (H) produced with transverse momentum (p_T) greater than 450 GeV and decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs (bb̅) is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at √(s) = 13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. The search is inclusive in the Higgs boson production mode. Highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons decaying to bb̅ are reconstructed as single large-radius jets, and are identified using jet substructure and a dedicated b tagging technique based on a deep neural network. The method is validated with Z→bb̅ decays. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events above the background assuming no Higgs boson production is observed with a local significance of 2.5 standard deviations (σ), while the expectation is 0.7. The corresponding signal strength and local significance with respect to the standard model expectation are μ_H = 3.7 ± 1.2 (stat)_-0.7^+0.6 (syst)_-0.5^+0.8 (theo) and 1.9σ. Additionally, an unfolded differential cross section as a function of Higgs boson p_T for the gluon fusion production mode is presented, assuming the other production modes occur at the expected rates.
Combined measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates in H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ and H→γγ final states using pp collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV in the ATLAS experiment. This note presents combined measurements based on Higgs boson production cross sections and branching ratios using more than 13.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at √(s)= 13 TeV. The combination is based on the analyses of the H→γγ and H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ decay channels. Results are derived for these two decay modes and five sets of production processes for a Higgs boson rapidity |y_H| < 2.5 and for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 ± 0.21 (stat)± 0.11 (syst) GeV. The global signal strength, defined as the ratio in the full phase space (including |y_H| ≥ 2.5) between the observed total signal yield and the Standard Model expectation, is measured to be μ = 1.13 ^+0.18_-0.17. The cross section of pp → H + X in the full phase space is determined from fiducial cross section measurements to be 59.0^+9.7_-9.2 (stat.) ^+4.4_-3.5 (syst.) pb, to be compared with the Standard Model prediction of 55.5^+2.4_-3.4 pb. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectations is observed.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson in the Z boson plus a photon channel in pp collisions at sqrt-s = 7 and 8 TeV. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into a boson and a photon is described. The analysis is performed using a dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 and 19.6 fb^-1, respectively. Limits are set on the cross section of a standard model Higgs boson decaying to opposite-sign electron or muon pairs and a photon. The expected exclusion limits at 95 in the mass range of 120 and 150 , and the observed limits are between about 3 and 31 times the standard model cross section.

We search for the b' quark decaying to a Higgs-boson and a b quark, assuming a branching ratio of 100
Search for the resonant production of a pair of Higgs bosons decaying to the bb-barZZ final state. A search for the production of two Higgs bosons decaying to bbZZ is presented. The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS detector during the 2016 proton-proton running of the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The bbZZ final states considered are the ones where one Z decays leptonically into two oppositely charged leptons (either two muons or two electrons), and the other Z decays either to two neutrinos or hadronically into two or more jets. Upper limits at 95
Search for dark matter produced in association with a dark Higgs boson decaying into W^± W^∓ or ZZ in fully hadronic final states from √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions recorded with the ATLAS detector. Several extensions of the Standard Model predict the production of dark matter particles at the LHC. An uncharted signature of dark matter particles produced in association with VV=W^± W^∓ or ZZ pairs from a decay of a dark Higgs boson s is searched for using 139 fb^-1 of pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The s→ V(qq̅)V(qq̅) decays are reconstructed with a novel technique aimed at resolving the dense topology from boosted VV pairs using jets in the calorimeter and tracking information. Dark Higgs scenarios with m_s > 160 GeV are excluded.
Search for resonant and non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in the four b quark final state using boosted jets in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV.

The final state consists of two b quark-antiquark pairs, with at least one Higgs boson highly Lorentz-boosted and reconstructed as a single large-area jet. The observations are consistent with the standard model prediction. Upper limits on the product of the cross sections and branching fractions of narrow bulk gravitons and radions, in warped extra-dimensional models, are set between 67 and 1.1 fb at 95
Search for Charged Higgs Bosons at LEP 2. A search for pair produced charged Higgs bosons has been performed in the high energy data collected by DELPHI at LEP with √(s) = 161, 172 and 183 GeV. The analysis uses the τντν, c s̅τν and c s̅c̅ s final states and a combination of event shape variables, di-jet masses and jet flavour tagging for the separation of a possible signal from the dominant W^+W^- and QCD backgrounds. The number of selected events has been found to be compatible with the expected background. The lower excluded value of the H^± mass obtained by varying the H^±→ hadrons decay branching ratio has been found to be 56.3 GeV/c^2.
Search for a heavy vector resonance decaying to a Z boson and a Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. This paper describes the search for a heavy vector resonance decaying into a Z boson and the standard model Higgs boson, where the Z boson is identified through its leptonic decays to electrons, muons, or neutrinos, and the Higgs boson is identified through its hadronic decays. The search is performed in a Lorentz-boosted regime for resonances with masses larger than 800 GeV. The data samples of proton-proton collisions were collected from 2016 to 2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at CERN and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. Upper limits are derived on the production of a narrow heavy resonance Z' as a function of the Z' mass, and a mass below 3.5 and 3.7 TeV is excluded at 95% confidence level in models where the heavy vector boson couples exclusively to fermions and to bosons, respectively. These are the most stringent limits placed on the Heavy Vector Triplet Z' model to date. If the heavy vector boson couples exclusively to standard model bosons, upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fraction are set between 23 and 0.3 fb for a Z' mass between 0.8 and 4.6 TeV, respectively. This is the first limit set on a heavy vector boson coupling exclusively to standard model bosons in its production and decay.
Search for a standard model Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs in pp collisions. A search for a standard model Higgs boson decaying to tau pairs is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV respectively. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 10 fb^-1, corresponding to 4.9 fb^-1 of data taken at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy and 5.1 fb^-1 of data taken at 8 TeV center-of-mass energy. No excess of events is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. In the mass range of 110–145 GeV upper limits at 95

The observed event rates are in agreement with expectations from the standard model. These results probe charginos and neutralinos with masses up to 720 GeV, and sleptons up to 280 GeV, depending on the model details.
Observation of Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair at the LHC with the ATLAS detector. The observation of Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair ( ttÂ¯H ), based on the analysis of protonâproton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, is presented. Using data corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 79.8 fb â1 , and considering Higgs boson decays into bbÂ¯ , WWâ , Ï+Ïâ , Î³Î³ , and ZZâ , the observed significance is 5.8 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 4.9 standard deviations. Combined with the ttÂ¯H searches using a dataset corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb â1 at 7 TeV and 20.3 fb â1 at 8 TeV, the observed (expected) significance is 6.3 (5.1) standard deviations. Assuming Standard Model branching fractions, the total ttÂ¯H production cross section at 13 TeV is measured to be 670 Â± 90 (stat.) â100+110 (syst.) fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.
Study of the Mass and Spin-Parity of the Higgs Boson Candidate via Its Decays to Z Boson Pairs. A study is presented of the mass and spin-parity of the new boson recently observed at the LHC at a mass near 125 GeV. An integrated luminosity of 17.3 inverse femtobarns, collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, is used. The measured mass in the ZZ channel, where both Z bosons decay to e or μ pairs, is 126.2 ± 0.6 (stat.) ± 0.2 (syst.) GeV. The angular distributions of the lepton pairs in this channel are sensitive to the spin-parity of the boson. Under the assumption of spin 0, the present data are consistent with the pure scalar hypothesis, while disfavoring the pure pseudoscalar hypothesis.
Projection of searches for exotic Higgs boson decays to light pseudoscalars for the High-Luminosity LHC. This Physics Analysis Summary details the projections of two searches for exotic decays of the Higgs boson from LHC Run 2 to the High-Luminosity LHC. Decays to a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons are explored, in the final states of two τ leptons and two muons, or two τ leptons and two b quarks. The projections are based on analyses that use 35.9 fb^-1 proton-proton collision data recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016. Integrated luminosities of up to 3000 fb^-1 are considered in the projections, with different scenarios for the extrapolation of the systematic uncertainties.
Update of the Combination of Higgs Boson Searches in pp Collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS Experiment at the LHC. The combination of searches for the Higgs boson by the ATLAS experiment with the first 1 fbâ1 of data taken in 2011 at the LHC is updated. The H â ZZ(â) â l+lâl+lâ and H â W W (â) â l+ Î½ lâ Î½ searches are complemented with additional datasets corresponding to 1.1 and 0.6 fbâ1 of integrated luminosity and now correspond to 2â2.3 fbâ1and 1.7 fbâ1 respectively. The H â WW(â) â l+Î½lâÎ½ channel analysis is improved and two channels searching for the Higgs boson decaying to tau leptons are now included. An excess of events is observed in the low mass range. Its significance is at most approximately 2 standard devi- ations above the expected SM background. The Higgs boson mass ranges from 146 GeV to 230 GeV, 256 GeV to 282 GeV and 296 GeV to 459 GeV are excluded at the 95% CL, while the expected Higgs boson mass exclusion in the absence of a signal ranges from 131 GeV to 450 GeV. The result of these searches is also interpreted in the framework of a Standard Model with the addition of a heavy sequential fourth generation of fermions. In this model Higgs boson masses above 119 GeV and up to 593 GeV are excluded at the 95%CL.
Measurements of tt̅H production and the CP structure of the Yukawa interaction between the Higgs boson and top quark in the diphoton decay channel. The first observation of the tt̅H process in a single Higgs boson decay channel with the full reconstruction of the final state (H→γγ) is presented, with a significance of 6.6 standard deviations (σ). The CP structure of Higgs boson couplings to fermions is measured, resulting in an exclusion of the pure CP-odd structure of the top Yukawa coupling at 3.2σ. The measurements are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s)= 13 TeV collected by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. The cross section times branching fraction of the tt̅H process is measured to be σ_tt̅Hℬ_γγ= 1.56^+0.34_-0.32 fb, which is compatible with the standard model prediction of 1.13^+0.08_-0.11 fb. The fractional contribution of the CP-odd component is measured to be f_CP^Htt = 0.00 ± 0.33.
Search for the Higgs boson in the H → WW → lν jj decay channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a Higgs boson has been performed in the H->WW->lvjj channel in 1.04/fb of pp collision data sqrts = 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess of events is observed over the expected background and limits on the Higgs boson production cross section are derived for a Higgs boson mass in the range 240 GeV < mH < 600 GeV. The best sensitivity is reached for mH = 400 GeV, where the 95% confidence level upper bound on the cross section for H->WW production is 3.1 pb, or 2.7 times the Standard Model prediction.
Search for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range 200-600 GeV in the H → ZZ → l^+l^-qq̅ decay channel with the ATLAS detector. A search for a heavy Standard Model Higgs boson decaying via H → ZZ → l^+l^-qq̅, where l=e or μ, is presented. The search uses a data set of pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^-1 collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC. No significant excess of events above the estimated background is found. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of a Higgs boson with a mass in the range between 200 and 600 GeV are derived. A Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range 300 ≤ m_H ≤ 322 GeV or 353 ≤ m_H ≤ 410 GeV is excluded at 95% CL. The corresponding expected exclusion range is 351 ≤ m_H ≤ 404 GeV at 95% CL.
Search for resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bblνlν final state at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for resonant Higgs bosons pair production decaying into bbWW with subsequent WW decays into two leptons and two neutrinos, X→HH→bbWW→bblνlν, is presented. The analysis is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb^-1. Masses are considered in the range between m_X = 260 GeV and 900 GeV. The search focuses on the invariant mass distribution of the b-jet pair, searching for a resonant-like excess compatible with the H boson mass in combination with a boosted decision tree discriminant based on kinematic information. Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within systematic uncertainties. For mass hypotheses from m_X = 500 GeV to m_X = 900 GeV, the data are observed (expected) to exclude a production cross-section times branching ratio of a spin-0 particle from 174 to 101 (135 to 75.8) fb.
Search for Neutral Higgs Boson Production and Decay to Tau Pairs. The results of a search for neutral MSSM Higgs boson production in pp collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV are presented, based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb^-1. We search for decays of the Higgs bosons to tau lepton pairs, using the final states with one identified e or μ from leptonic tau decay plus a reconstructed hadronic decay of a tau lepton, and also the final state with two leptonic tau decays, and then fully reconstruct the original tau lepton pair kinematics using a novel likelihood algorithm. No excess is observed in the fully reconstructed tau pair invariant mass spectrum. The resulting upper bounds on the Higgs production cross section times branching ratio to tau pairs as a function of the Higgs boson mass yield stringent new bounds in the MSSM parameter space m_A versus tanβ, extending as low as tanβ = 23 for m_A=130 GeV/c^2.
Combined coupling measurements of the Higgs-like boson with the ATLAS detector using up to 25 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. This note presents an update of the measurements of the properties of the newly discovered boson using the full pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for the channels H →γγ, H→ ZZ^(*)→ 4l and H → WW^(*)→ l ν l ν, corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 4.8 fb^-1 at √(s)=7TeV and 20.7 fb^-1 at √(s)=8TeV. The combination also includes results from the H →τ^+ τ^- and H → bb̅ channels based on pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 4.7 fb^-1 at √(s)=7TeV and 13 fb^-1 at √(s)=8TeV. The combined signal strength is determined to be μ = 1.30 ± 0.13 (stat)± 0.14 (sys) at a mass of 125.5 GeV. The cross section ratio between vector boson mediated and gluon (top) initiated Higgs boson production processes is found to be μ_VBF+VH/μ_ggF+tt̅H=1.2^+0.7_-0.5, giving more than 3σ evidence for Higgs-like boson production through vector-boson fusion. Measurements of relative branching fraction ratios between the H →γγ, H → ZZ^(*)→ 4l and H → WW^(*)→ l ν l ν channels, as well as combined fits testing the fermion and vector coupling sector, couplings to W and Z and loop induced processes of the Higgs-like boson show no significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation.
Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel using 80 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This note reports measurements of Higgs boson properties in the two-photon final state using 79.8 fb^-1 of data recorded at √(s)=13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The cross sections of Higgs boson production through gluon–gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, and in association with a vector boson or a top-quark pair are measured. Measurements of the Higgs boson production divided further into kinematic regions, called simplified template cross sections, are also reported. Additionally, the cross section for the production of the Higgs boson decaying to two isolated photons is measured in a fiducial phase space designed to closely match the ATLAS detector acceptance, and is found to be 60.4 ± 6.1 (stat.) ± 6.0 (exp.) ± 0.3 (theo.) fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 63.5 ± 3.3 fb. Finally, the fiducial cross section is measured differentially in bins of several kinematic observables with sensitivity to properties of the Higgs boson. Among these, the number of b-jets produced in association with the Higgs boson is measured to probe Higgs production in association with heavy flavor hadrons. No significant deviations between the observed data and the Standard Model prediction are observed.
An update of combined measurements of the new Higgs-like boson with high mass resolution channels. An update is presented of the measurement of the newly discovered boson properties using the high mass resolution channels, H→ γγ and H → ZZ^(*)→ 4ℓ, with up to 4.8 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s)=7 TeV and 13 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV. The combined mass measurement derived from the H→ γγ and H → ZZ^(*)→ 4ℓ channels is m_H=125.2 ± 0.3 (stat) ± 0.6 (sys) GeV. The combination of all final states, including the recently updated low mass resolution channels H→ WW^(*)→ ℓνℓν, H →τ^+τ^- and H → bb̅, is reported for this data set in terms of the combined signal strength (μ). This is determined to be μ = 1.35 ± 0.24 computed at a mass of 125 GeV, in agreement with the Standard Model expectation.
Measurement of W^+W^- Production and Search for the Higgs Boson in pp Collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. A measurement of W^+W^- production in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and a search for the Higgs boson are reported. The W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with two leptons, either electrons or muons. The measurement is performed using LHC data recorded with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 inverse picobarns. The pp to W^+W^- cross section is measured to be 41.1 Â± 15.3 (stat) Â± 5.8 (syst) Â± 4.5 (lumi) pb, consistent with the standard model prediction. Limits on WW gamma and WWZ anomalous triple gauge couplings are set. The search for the standard model Higgs boson in the W^+W^- decay mode does not reveal any evidence of excess above backgrounds. Limits are set on the production of the Higgs boson in the context of the standard model and in the presence of a sequential fourth family of fermions with high masses. In the latter context, a Higgs boson with mass between 144 and 207 GeV/c2 is ruled out at 95% confidence level.
A search for the rare decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson to dimuons in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. A search for the dimuon decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson was performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 79.8 fb^-1 collected so far in Run 2 with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess is observed above the expected background. The observed upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio is 2.1 times the Standard Model prediction at 95
Search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons in the CMS detector. This note describes the search for a Higgs boson decaying into diphotons in pp collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Data-driven methods are used to evaluate the reconstruction and selection performance for the signal, and the background is evaluated from a fit to the data. The analysis is performed on a dataset corresponding to 4.8 fb^-1 of data recorded in 2011 by the CMS experiment. Limits are set on the cross section of a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to two photons. The expected exclusion limit at 95 the Standard Model cross section in the mass range between 110 and 140 GeV/c^2, and the observed limit disfavours at 95 Higgs boson decaying into two photons in the mass range 127 to 131 GeV/c^2.
A Particle Consistent with the Higgs Boson Observed with the ATLAS Detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Nearly 50 years ago, theoretical physicists proposed that a field permeates the universe and gives energy to the vacuum. This field was required to explain why some, but not all, fundamental particles have mass. Numerous precision measurements during recent decades have provided indirect support for the existence of this field, but one crucial prediction of this theory has remained unconfirmed despite 30 years of experimental searches: the existence of a massive particle, the standard model Higgs boson. The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN has now observed the production of a new particle with a mass of 126 gigaâelectron volts and decay signatures consistent with those expected for the Higgs particle. This result is strong support for the standard model of particle physics, including the presence of this vacuum field. The existence and properties of the newly discovered particle may also have consequences beyond the standard model itself.
Search for the decays of the Higgs boson H → ee and H → eμ in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Searches for the decay of the Higgs boson H → ee and H → e μ are performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 bf^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV at the LHC. No significant signals are observed, in agreement with the Standard Model expectation. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the branching fraction of H → ee is 3.6 × 10^-4 (3.5 × 10^-4) and on H → eμ is 6.1× 10^-5 (5.8× 10^-5). These results represent an improvement of a factor of about 5 and 6 on the previous best limits on the branching fractions of H → ee and H → e μ, respectively.
Search for Charged Higgs Bosons at LEP. A search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons is performed with the L3 detector at LEP using data collected at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 629.4/pb. Decays into a charm and a strange quark or into a tau lepton and its neutrino are considered. No significant excess is observed and lower limits on the mass of the charged Higgs boson are derived at the 95% confidence level. They vary from 76.5 to 82.7GeV, as a function of the H->tv branching ratio.
Observation of an Excess in the Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson at ALEPH. A search has been performed for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the data sample collected with the ALEPH detector at LEP, at centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV. An excess of 3 σ beyond the background expectation is found, consistent with the production of the Higgs boson with a mass near 114 GeV=c^2 . Much of this excess is seen in the four-jet analyses, where three high purity events are selected.
A search using multivariate techniques for a standard model Higgs boson decaying into two photons. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons is described. The analysis is performed using a dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb^-1. Limits are set on the cross section of a standard model Higgs boson decaying to two photons. The expected exclusion limit at 95 The observed limit excludes at 95 Higgs boson decaying into two photons in the mass ranges 110.0-111.0, 117.5-120.5, 128.5-132.0, 139.0-140.0 and 146.0-147.0 GeV. The largest excess of events over the expected background is observed around 125 GeV. Taking into account the look-elsewhere effect in the search range 110-150 GeV the excess has a global significance of 1.6 standard deviations. More data are required to ascertain the origin of this excess.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in the H^±→ tb decay channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV using the ATLAS detector. Charged Higgs bosons heavier than the top quark and decaying via H^±→ tb are searched for in proton–proton collisions measured with the ATLAS experiment at √(s)=8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1. The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with a top quark, gb → tH^±, is explored in the mass range 200 to 600 GeV using multi-jet final states with one electron or muon. In order to separate the signal from the Standard Model background, analysis techniques combining several kinematic variables are employed. An excess of events above the background-only hypothesis is observed across a wide mass range, amounting to up to 2.4 standard deviations. Upper limits are set on the gb→ tH^± production cross section times the branching fraction BR(H^±→ tb). Additionally, the complementary s-channel production, qq' → H^±, is investigated through a reinterpretation of W' → tb searches in ATLAS. Final states with one electron or muon are relevant for H^± masses from 0.4 to 2.0 TeV, whereas the all-hadronic final state covers the range 1.5 to 3.0 TeV. In these search channels, no significant excesses from the predictions of the Standard Model are observed, and upper limits are placed on the qq' → H^± production cross section times the branching fraction BR(H^±→ tb).
Study of discriminating variables for charged Higgs boson searches in ttbar events with leptons, using 35/pb of data from the ATLAS detector. In several extensions of the Standard Model, the top-quark can decay to a bottom-quark and a light charged Higgs boson (m_H^+<m_top) which is assumed to decay only into τν. Discriminating variables were identified, which allow the distinction between the leptons produced in τ→ l+ ν (arising in decays of W or charged Higgs bosons) and the leptons coming directly from W boson decays. This paper aims at validating these variables, in single-lepton and dilepton tt̅ events, through a comparison between Monte Carlo simulations and 35 pb^-1 of ATLAS data collected in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC, in 2010. We find that Monte Carlo simulations agree well with the ATLAS data. The impact of systematic uncertainties is also discussed.
Limits on the Higgs boson lifetime and width from its decay to four charged leptons. Constraints on the lifetime and width of the Higgs boson are obtained from H→ZZ→ 4ℓ events using data recorded by the CMS experiment during the LHC run 1 with an integrated luminosity of 5.1 and 19.7 fb^-1 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The measurement of the Higgs boson lifetime is derived from its flight distance in the CMS detector with an upper bound of τ_H lower than 1.9 × 10^-13 s at the 95% confidence level (CL), corresponding to a lower bound on the width of Γ_H larger than 3.5 × 10^-9 MeV. The measurement of the width is obtained from an off-shell production technique, generalized to include anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson to two electroweak bosons. From this measurement, a joint constraint is set on the Higgs boson width and a parameter f_Λ Q that expresses an anomalous coupling contribution as an on-shell cross-section fraction. The limit on the Higgs boson width is Γ_H lower than 46 MeV with f_Λ Q unconstrained and Γ_H lower than 26 MeV for f_Λ Q=0 at the 95% CL. The constraint f_Λ Q lower than 3.8 × 10^-3 at the 95% CL is obtained for the expected standard model Higgs boson width.
Searches for heavy Higgs bosons in two-Higgs-doublet models and for tâch decay using multilepton and diphoton final states in pp collisions at 8 TeV. Searches are presented for heavy scalar (H) and pseudoscalar (A) Higgs bosons posited in the two doublet model (2HDM) extensions of the standard model (SM). These searches are based on a data sample of pp collisions collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb^-1. The decays H→hh and A→Zh, where h denotes an SM-like Higgs boson, lead to events with three or more isolated charged leptons or with a photon pair accompanied by one or more isolated leptons. The search results are presented in terms of the H and A production cross sections times branching fractions and are further interpreted in terms of 2HDM parameters. We place 95% CL cross section upper limits of approximately 7 pb on σℬ for H→hh and 2 pb for A→Zh. Also presented are the results of a search for the rare decay of the top quark that results in a charm quark and an SM Higgs boson, t→ch, the existence of which would indicate a nonzero flavor-changing Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs boson. We place a 95% CL upper limit of 0.56% on ℬ(t→ch).
Higgs boson production in association with top quarks in final states with electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying tau leptons at √(s) = 13 TeV. The rate for Higgs (H) bosons production in association with either one (tH) or two (tt̅H) top quarks is measured in final states with multiple electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying τ leptons, using proton-proton collision data recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment. The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. The analysis targets events where the H boson decays via H→WW, H→ττ, or H→ZZ and the top quark(s) decay either leptonically or hadronically. The signal yield is maximized by including ten different signatures in the analysis depending on the lepton multiplicity. The separation of the H boson signal from backgrounds is enhanced by machine learning techniques and matrix element methods. The measured production rates for the tt̅H and tH signals amount to 0.92 ± 0.19 (stat) ^+0.17_-0.13 (syst) and 5.7 ± 2.7 (stat)± 3.0 (syst) times their respective standard model (SM) expectations. Assuming that the H boson coupling to the τ lepton is equal in strength to the values expected in the SM, the coupling y_t of the H boson to the top quark is constrained, at 95
Search for the Higgs Boson in the Fully Leptonic W^+W^- Final State. This note reports a search for the Higgs boson decaying to W^+W^- in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. The analysis is performed using LHC data recorded with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.5 fb^-1. W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with two leptons, electrons or muons. No significant excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed, and upper limits on Higgs boson production are derived, excluding the presence of a Higgs boson with a mass in the range [147 - 194] GeV/c^2 at 95
Search for γγ decays of a Higgs boson in e^+e^- collisions at √(s) up to 209 GeV. A search for events with a photon pair arising from the decay of a Higgs boson produced in association with a fermion pair, is performed in 893pb^-1 of data recorded by the ALEPH detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies up to 209GeV. No excess of such events is found over the expected background. An upper limit is derived on the product of the e^+e^- -> HZ cross section and the H -> gamma gamma branching fraction as a function of the Higgs boson mass. A fermiophobic Higgs boson produced with the Standard Model cross section is excluded at 95
Search for Invisibly Decaying Higgs Bosons with Large Decay Width Using the OPAL Detector at LEP. This paper describes a topological search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson,H, produced via the Bjorken process (e+e- -> HZ). The analysis is based on data recorded using the OPAL detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies from 183 to 209 GeV corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 629pb-1. In the analysis only hadronic decays of the Z boson are considered. A scan over Higgs boson masses from 1 to 120 GeV and decay widths from 1 to 3000 GeV revealed no indication for a signal in the data. From a likelihood ratio of expected signal and Standard Model background we determine upper limits on cross-section times branching ratio to an invisible final state. For moderate Higgs boson decay widths, these range from about 0.07pb Mh = 60GeV) to 0.57pb (Mh = 114GeV). For decay widths above 200GeV the upper limits are of the order of 0.15pb. The results can be interpreted in general scenarios predicting a large invisible decay width of the Higgs boson. As an example we interpret the results in the so-called stealthy Higgs scenario. The limits from this analysis exclude a large part of the parameter range of this scenario experimentally accessible at LEP2.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in e^+ e^- interactions at √(s) = 189 GeV. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson is carried out on 176.4 pb^-1 of data collected by the L3 detector at a center-of-mass energy of 189 Ge -0.1em V. The data are consistent with the expectations of Standard Model processes and no evidence of a Higgs signal is observed. Combining the results of this search with those at lower center-of-mass energies, a lower limit on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson of 95.3 Ge -0.1em V is set at the 95
Search for a high-mass Higgs boson in the H → WW → lν lν decay channel with the ATLAS detector using 21 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. A search by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider for a Higgs boson in the H → WW →ℓνℓν channel in the range 260 GeV < m_H < 1 TeV is presented. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.7 fb^-1. A Higgs boson with Standard Model-like couplings is excluded at 95

A search for decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of new spin-zero particles, H → aa, where the a-bosons decay into a b-quark pair and muon pair, is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the branching ratio (σ_H / σ_SM) × B(H→ aa→ bbμμ), ranging from 2× 10^-4 to 10^-3 in the a-boson mass range of 20-60 GeV. Model-independent limits are set on the visible production cross-section times the branching ratio to the bbμμ final state for new physics, σ_vis(X) × B(X→ bbμμ), ranging from 0.1 fb to 0.73 fb for m_μμ between 18 and 62 GeV.
Search for invisible Higgs boson decays with vector boson fusion signatures with the ATLAS detector using an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. A direct search for Higgs bosons that are produced via vector boson fusion and subsequently decay into invisible particles is reported.The analysis uses 139 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The observed number of events are found to be in agreement with the background expectation from Standard Model processes. Assuming a 125 GeV scalar Higgs boson with a Standard Model production cross section, both the observed and expected upper limits on the branching fraction of its decay into invisible particles are derived to be 0.13 at 95
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons at LEP. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for the neutral Higgs bosons which are predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The data of the four collaborations are statistically combined and examined for their consistency with the background hypothesis and with a possible Higgs boson signal. The combined LEP data show no significant excess of events which would indicate the production of Higgs bosons. The search results are used to set upper bounds on the cross-sections of various Higgs-like event topologies. The results are interpreted within the MSSM in a number of “benchmark" models, including CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. These interpretations lead in all cases to large exclusions in the MSSM parameter space. Absolute limits are set on the parameter tanb and, in some scenarios, on the masses of neutral Higgs bosons.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson at LEP. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have collected a total of 2461 pb-1 of e+e- collision data at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. The data are used to search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The search results of the four collaborations are combined and examined in a likelihood test for their consistency with two hypotheses: the background hypothesis and the signal plus background hypothesis. The corresponding confidences have been computed as functions of the hypothetical Higgs boson mass. A lower bound of 114.4 GeV/c2 is established, at the 95% confidence level, on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson. The LEP data are also used to set upper bounds on the HZZ coupling for various assumptions concerning the decay of the Higgs boson.
Search for the Single Production of Doubly-Charged Higgs Bosons and Constraints on their Couplings from Bhabha Scattering. A search for single production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons has been performed using 600.7 pb^-1 of e+e- collision data with sqrt(s)=189–209GeV collected by the OPAL detector at LEP. No evidence for the existence of H++/– is observed. Upper limits on the Yukawa coupling of the H++/– to like-signed electron pairs are derived. Additionally, indirect constraints on the Yukawa coupling from Bhabha scattering, where the H++/– would contribute via t-channel exchange, are derived for M(H++/–) < 2TeV. These are the first results for both a single production search and constraints from Bhabha scattering reported from LEP.
Search for non-resonant pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb̅bb̅ final state with 13 TeV CMS data. A search for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV is presented. The Higgs bosons are searched in the bb̅ final state. The data have been collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during the year 2015, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.32 fb^-1. No signal is observed and an upper limit of 3880 fb is set on the cross section of non-resonant Higgs pair-production times branching fraction squared of the H→bb̅ decay.
Search for a charged Higgs boson decaying to charm and bottom quarks in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for charged Higgs boson decaying to a charm and a bottom quark (H^+→cb̅) is performed using 19.7 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 8 TeV. The production mechanism investigated in this search is tt̅ pair production in which one top quark decays to a charged Higgs boson and a bottom quark and the other decays to a charged lepton, a neutrino, and a bottom quark. Charged Higgs boson decays to cb̅ are searched for, resulting in a final state containing at least four jets, a charged lepton (muon or electron), and missing transverse momentum. A kinematic fit is performed to identify the pair of jets least likely to be the bottom quarks originating from direct top quark decays and the invariant mass of this pair is used as the final observable in the search. No evidence for the presence of a charged Higgs boson is observed and upper limits at 95% confidence level of 0.8-0.5% are set on the branching fraction ℬ (t→H^+b ), assuming ℬ (H^+→cb̅ ) = 1.0 and ℬ (t→H^+b ) + ℬ (t→Wb ) = 1.0, for the charged Higgs boson mass range 90-150 GeV.
Measurements of Higgs Bosons Decaying to Bottom Quarks from Vector Boson Fusion Production with the ATLAS Experiment at √(s)=13 TeV. The paper presents a measurement of the Standard Model Higgs Boson decaying to b-quark pairs in the vector boson fusion (VBF) production mode. A sample corresponding to 126 fb^-1 of √(s) = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data, collected with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, is analyzed utilizing an adversarial neural network for event classification. The results are combined with an analysis of Higgs bosons decaying to b-quarks, produced via VBF in association with a photon. The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the measured signal yield to that predicted by the Standard Model, is measured to be 0.99^+0.35_-0.33 for Higgs boson production or 0.99^+0.36_-0.34 for VBF production only, corresponding to an observed (expected) significance of 3.0 (3.0) or 2.9 (2.9) standard deviations, respectively, from the background only hypothesis. The sensitivity of the measurement is dominated by the analysis presented in this paper.
Search for the standard model Higgs Boson in the decay channel H to ZZ to llqq at CMS. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to two Z bosons with subsequent decay to a final state with two leptons and two quark-jets, HZZℓ^-ℓ^+qq̅, is presented. Data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb^-1 of LHC proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV were collected and analyzed by the CMS experiment. The selection to discriminate between signal and background events is based on kinematic and topological quantities, which include the angular spin correlations of the decay products. The events are classified according to probability of the jets to originate from quarks of light or heavy flavor or from gluons. No evidence for a Higgs boson is found and upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section are set in the range of masses between 226 GeV/c^2 and 600 GeV/c^2.
Search for a light pseudo–scalar Higgs boson produced in association with bottom quarks in pp collisions at 8 TeV. We report on the search for a light pseudo–scalar Higgs boson produced in association with a bottom quark and decaying into dimuons. The search makes use of 19.8 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. No signal is observed in the search for a pseudo–scalar Higgs boson and upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are set.
Search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalars in the final state with two b quarks and two τ leptons. A search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons is performed in the final state with two b jets and two τ leptons. The motivation lies in models beyond the standard model (SM), such as two-Higgs-doublet models extended with a complex scalar singlet, which include the next-to-minimal supersymmetric SM (NMSSM). The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy. Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15 and 60 GeV are probed, and upper limits as low as 23
Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson in ATLAS. A search for evidence of invisible-particle decay modes of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. No deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed in 4.5 fb^â1 (20.3 fb^â1) of 7 (8) TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment. Assuming the Standard Model rate for ZH production, an upper limit of 75%, at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio to invisible-particle decay modes of the Higgs boson at a mass of 125.5 GeV. The limit on the branching ratio is also interpreted in terms of an upper limit on the allowed dark matterânucleon scattering cross section within a Higgs-portal dark matter scenario. Limits are also set on an additional neutral Higgs boson, in the mass range 110 < m_H < 400 GeV, produced in association with a Z boson and decaying to invisible particles.
Search for the Decay of the Higgs Boson to Charm Quarks with the ATLAS Experiment. A direct search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of charm quarks is presented. Associated production of the Higgs and Z bosons, in the decay mode ZH→ℓ^+ ℓ^- c c̅ is studied. A dataset with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC is used. The H→ cc̅ signature is identified using charm-tagging algorithms. The observed (expected) upper limit on σ(pp → ZH) ×ℬ(H → cc̅) is 2.7 (3.9^+2.1_-1.1) pb at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, while the Standard Model value is 26 fb.
Measurements of Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and vector boson fusion in the diphoton decay channel at √(s) = 13 TeV. Measurements of the Higgs boson production cross sections with the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of photons are reported. Events with two photons are selected from a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and 2017, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb^-1. Cross sections for gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production, normalized to the corresponding standard model predictions, are measured to be 1.15_-0.15^+0.15 and 0.8_-0.3^+0.4, respectively. These production modes are further measured in kinematic regions within the simplified template cross section framework. All results are found to be in agreement with the standard model expectations.
Search for Single Production of a Vector Like T Quark Decaying to a Higgs Boson and a Leptonically Decaying Top Quark. We search for singly produced vector-like top quark partners (T) in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC. This is of particular interest, as the rate of single production of TeV-scale vector-like quarks increases faster than the rate of pair production with increasing centre-of-mass energy. The decay of a vector-like T quark into a Higgs boson and a top quark is searched for. The top quark decay includes an electron or a muon and the Higgs boson decays into a pair of b quarks. No significant excess over standard model backgrounds is observed. Exclusion limits on the production cross section times branching fraction, as well as exclusion limits on T quark coupling parameters are derived in the mass-range of 700 GeV to 1800 GeV. For a mass of 1000 GeV, we exclude production cross section times branching fractions above 0.9 pb and 0.6 pb at 95 This document has been revised with respect to the version dated April 1, 2016.
Search for Higgs Bosons and Other Massive States decaying into two Photons in e^+e^- Collisions at 189 GeV. A search is described for the generic process e+e- to X Y, where X is a neutral heavy scalar boson decaying into a pair of photons, and Y is a neutral heavy boson (scalar or vector) decaying into a fermion pair. The search is motivated mainly by the cases where either X, or both X and Y, are Higgs bosons. In particular, we investigate the case where X is the Standard Model Higgs boson and Y the Z0 boson. Other models with enhanced Higgs boson decay couplings to photon pairs are also considered. The present search combines the data set collected by the OPAL collaboration at 189 GeV collider energy, having an integrated luminosity of 182.6pb-1, with data samples collected at lower energies. The search results have been used to put 95% confidence level bounds, as functions of the mass of X, on the product of the cross-section and the relevant branching ratios, both in a model independent manner and for the particular models considered.
Search for the Higgs Boson in the Diphoton Channel with the ATLAS Detector using 209 pb-1 of 7 TeV Data taken in 2011. This note presents the result of a search for a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of photons in pp collision data collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)=7 TeV. In the 209 pb-1 of data analysed no statistically significant excess is observed. A 95% CL exclusion limit on the production cross section of a Higgs boson decaying into two photons relative to the Standard Model cross section is given.
Searches for neutral Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- collisions from √(s) = 191.6 to 201.7 GeV. Neutral Higgs bosons of the Standard Model (SM) and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) were searched for in the data collected in 1999 by the DELPHI experiment at centre-of-mass energies between 191.6 and 201.7 GeV with a total integrated luminosity of 228 pb^-1. These analyses, in combination with our results at lower energies, set 95
Search for Higgs boson pair production in the final state of γγ WW^*(→ lν jj) using 13.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data recorded at √(s)= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Searches for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production are performed in the final state of γγ WW^*(→ lν jj) using 13.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded at √(s)= 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant deviation from the Standard Model prediction is observed in data. A 95% confidence-level observed upper limit of 25.0 pb is set on the cross section for non-resonant production, while the expected limit is 12.9 pb. With the same set of data, a narrow-width X→ hh resonance is searched for and the corresponding observed (expected) upper limits range between 47.7 pb (24.3 pb) and 24.7 pb (12.7 pb) for masses of the resonance between 260 and 500 GeV.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production, fiducial and differential cross sections in the 4ℓ decay channel at √(s)=13 with the ATLAS detector. Inclusive, differential and production mode cross sections of the Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions are measured in the H → ZZ^*→ 4ℓ decay channel. The proton-proton collision data were produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector from 2015 to 2017, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 79.8 fb^-1. The inclusive fiducial cross section for the process H → ZZ^*→ 4ℓ is measured to be σ_fid = 4.04 ± 0.47 fb, while the Standard Model prediction is σ_fid, SM = 3.35 ± 0.15 fb. The cross-section times H → ZZ^* branching ratio for gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion production are measured to be 1.21 ± 0.18 pb and 0.24 ± 0.09 pb, respectively. All measurements are in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.
Search for Higgs and Z boson decays to J/ψ or Υ pairs in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for decays of the Higgs and Z boson to pairs of J/ψ or Υ(nS) (n=1,2,3) mesons, with their subsequent decay to μ^+μ^- pairs, is presented. The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2017 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 37.5 fb^-1. While an observation of such a decay with this sample would indicate the presence of physics beyond the standard model, no significant excess is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the branching fractions of these decays. In the J/ψ pair channel, the limits are 1.8 × 10^-3 and 2.2 × 10^-6 for the Higgs and Z boson, respectively, while in the combined Υ(nS) pair channel, the limits are 1.4 × 10^-3 and 1.5 × 10^-6, respectively, when the mesons from the Higgs and Z boson decay are assumed to be unpolarized. When fully longitudinal and transverse polarizations are considered the limits reduce by about 22-29% and increase by about 10-13%, respectively.
Search for a very light NMSSM Higgs boson produced in decays of the 125 GeV scalar boson and decaying into τ leptons in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for a very light Higgs boson decaying into a pair of τ leptons is presented within the framework of the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model. This search is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The signal is defined by the production of either of the two lightest scalars, h_1 or h_2, via gluon-gluon fusion and subsequent decay into a pair of the lightest Higgs bosons, a_1 or h_1. The h_1 or h_2 boson is identified with the observed state at a mass of 125 GeV. The analysis searches for decays of the a_1 ( h_1 ) states into pairs of τ leptons and covers a mass range for the a_1 ( h_1 ) boson of 4 to 8 GeV. The search reveals no significant excess in data above standard model background expectations, and an upper limit is set on the signal production cross section times branching fraction as a function of the a_1 ( h_1 ) boson mass. The 95% confidence level limit ranges from 4.5 pb at m_ a_1 (m_ h_1 )= 8 GeV to 10.3 pb at m_ a_1 (m_ h_1 ) = 5 GeV.
Search for new phenomena in events with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to two photons in p p collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for new phenomena in events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to two photons. The search uses 3.2 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015. The results are interpreted in two theoretical models: decays of a heavy scalar into a Higgs boson and a pair of dark matter candidates, and a vector mediator emitting a Higgs boson and decaying into two dark matter candidates. No excess over the background expectation is observed and upper limits are set on the rates of these processes.
Search for invisible Higgs boson decays in vector boson fusion at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. We report a search for Higgs bosons that are produced via vector boson fusion and subsequently decay into invisible particles. The experimental signature is two energetic jets with 𝒪(1) TeV invariant mass and 𝒪(100) GeV missing transverse momentum. The analysis uses 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collision data at 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. In the signal region the 2252 observed events are consistent with the background estimation. Assuming a 125 GeV particle with Standard Model cross sections, the upper limit on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay into invisible particles is 0.37 at 95% confidence level where 0.28 was expected. This limit is interpreted in Higgs portal models to set limits on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section. We also consider invisible decays of additional scalar bosons with masses up to 3 TeV for which the upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are in the range of 0.3-2.0 pb.
Search for a Higgs boson produced in the decay channel 4l. A search for a Higgs boson in the four-lepton decay channel H→ ZZ^(*), with each Z boson decaying to an electron or muon pair, is presented using 4.71 ± 0.21 of integrated luminosity recorded by the CMS detector in pp collisions from the LHC at √(s) = 7 TeV. The search covers Higgs boson mass hypotheses of 110 < m_ H < 600. Seventy-two events are observed with 4ℓ invariant mass m_4ℓ > 100 (with thirteen below 160), while 67.1 ± 6.0 (9.5 ± 1.3) events are expected from standard model background processes. Their 4ℓ mass distribution is consistent with the expectation of standard model continuum production of ZZ^(*) pairs, with no significant excess at any mass in the range under study. Upper limits at 95 exclude the standard model Higgs boson in the ranges 134 < m_ H < 158, 180 < m_ H < 305 and 340 < m_ H < 465.
Search for a CP-odd Higgs boson decaying to Zh in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a heavy, CP-odd Higgs boson, A, decaying into a Z boson and a 125 GeV Higgs boson, h, with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The search uses proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1. Decays of CP-even h bosons to ττ or bb pairs with the Z boson decaying to electron or muon pairs are considered, as well as h → bb decays with the Z boson decaying to neutrinos. No evidence for the production of an A boson in these channels is found and the 95% confidence level upper limits derived for σ (gg→ A) ×(A→ Zh) ×(h→ ff̅) are 0.098–0.013 pb for f=τ and 0.57–0.014 pb for f=b in a range of m_A = 220–1000 GeV. The results are combined and interpreted in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models.
Search for direct production of electroweakinos in final states with one lepton, missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying into two b-jets in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The results of a search for electroweakino pair production pp →χ̃^±_1 χ̃^0_2 in which the chargino (χ̃^±_1) decays into a W boson and the lightest neutralino (χ̃^0_1), while the heavier neutralino (χ̃^0_2) decays into the Standard Model 125 GeV Higgs boson and a second χ̃^0_1 are presented. The signal selection requires a pair of b-tagged jets consistent with those from a Higgs boson decay, either an electron or muon from the W boson decay, together with missing transverse momentum from the corresponding neutrino and the stable neutralinos. The analysis is based on data corresponding to 139 fb^-1 of √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions provided by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector. No statistically-significant evidence is found for an excess of events above the Standard Model expectation. Limits are set on the direct production of the electroweakinos in simplified models, assuming pure wino cross sections. Masses of χ̃^±_1/χ̃^0_2 up to 740 GeV are excluded at 95
Searches for Higgs boson pair production in the hh→ bbττ, γγ WW*, γγ bb, bbbb channels with the ATLAS detector. Searches for both resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production are performed in the hh→ bbττ, γγ WW^* final states using 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of their production is observed and 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross sections are set. These results are then combined with the published results of the hh→γγ bb, bbbb analyses. An upper limit of 0.69 (0.47) pb on the non-resonant Standard Model like hh production is observed (expected), corresponding to 70 (48) times of the SM gg→ hh cross section. For production via narrow resonances, cross section limits of hh production from a heavy Higgs boson decay are set as a function of the heavy Higgs boson mass. The observed (expected) limits range from 2.1 (1.1) pb at 260 GeV to 0.011 (0.018) pb at 1000 GeV. These results are interpreted in the context of two simplified scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
Searches for Higgs bosons.
Search for lepton-flavour-violating H→μτ decays of the Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector. A direct search for lepton–flavour–violating (LFV) H→μτ decays of the recently discovered Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The analysis is performed in the H→μτ_had channel, where τ_had is a hadronically decaying τ–lepton. The search is based on the data sample of proton–proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 at a centre–of–mass energy of √(s)=8 TeV. No statistically significant excess of data over the predicted background is observed. The observed (expected) 95% confidence–level upper limit on the branching fraction, Br(H→μτ), is 1.85% (1.24%).
Higgs boson production cross-section measurements and their EFT interpretation in the 4ℓ decay channel at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Higgs boson properties are studied in the four-lepton decay channel (where lepton = e, μ) using 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded at √(s) = 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The inclusive cross-section times branching ratio for H→ ZZ^* decay is measured to be 1.34 ± 0.12 pb for a Higgs boson with absolute rapidity below 2.5, in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 1.33 ± 0.08 pb. Cross-sections times branching ratio are measured for the main Higgs boson production modes in several exclusive phase-space regions. The measurements are interpreted in terms of coupling modifiers and of the tensor structure of Higgs boson interactions using an effective field theory approach. Exclusion limits are set on the CP-even and CP-odd `beyond the Standard Model' couplings of the Higgs boson to vector bosons, gluons and top quarks.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and constraints on its couplings from a combined ATLAS and CMS analysis of the LHC pp collision data at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes in several or all of the Higgs boson decay modes. It makes use of the LHC proton-proton collision datasets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of 5 fb-1 at sqrt(s)=7 TeV and 20 fb-1 at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates of the two experiments are combined within the context of two generic parameterisations: one based on ratios of cross sections and branching ratios and the other based on ratios of coupling modifiers, introduced within the context of a leading-order Higgs boson coupling framework. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model expectation is measured to be 1.09 +- 0.11 and the combination of the two experiments leads to observed significances of the VBF production process and of the H to tau-tau decay at the level of 5.4sigma and 5.5sigma, respectively. Several interpretations of the results with more model-dependent parameterisations, derived from the generic ones, are also given. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.
Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson decaying into four leptons in pp collisions at sqrts = 13 TeV. Properties of the Higgs boson are measured in the H→ Z Z→4ℓ (ℓ= e,μ) decay channel. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The signal-strength modifier μ, defined as the production cross section of the Higgs boson times its branching fraction to four leptons relative to the standard model expectation, is measured to be μ=1.05^+0.19_-0.17 at m_H=125.09 GeV. The signal-strength modifiers for the main Higgs boson production modes have also been constrained. The mass is measured to be m_H=125.26 ± 0.21 GeV and the width is constrained using on-shell production to be Γ_H<1.10 GeV, at 95
Search for the dimuon decay of the Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the dimuon decay of the Higgs boson was performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess is observed above the expected background. The observed (expected) upper limit on the cross-section times branching ratio is 3.0 (3.1) times the Standard Model prediction at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. When combined with the pp collision data at √(s)=7 TeV and √(s)=8 TeV, the observed (expected) upper limit is 2.8 (2.9) times the Standard Model prediction.
Constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings in production and decay H→4ℓ. The study of the anomalous interactions of the recently discovered Higgs boson is performed using the decay information H→ 4ℓ and information from associated production of two quark jets, originating either from vector boson fusion or associated vector boson. The full dataset recorded by the CMS experiment during 2016 of the LHC Run 2 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 at 13 TeV. Novel techniques are used for the study of associated VBF and VH production and its combination with analysis of decay information using optimal approaches based on matrix element techniques. The tensor structure of the interactions of the spin-zero Higgs boson with two vector bosons either in production or in decay is investigated and constraints are set on anomalous HVV interactions. All observations are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson.
Search for the fermiophobic model Higgs boson decaying into two photons. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons is described. The analysis is performed using a dataset recorded in 2011 by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb^-1. Limits are set on the cross section of the fermiophobic model Higgs boson decaying to two photons. The expected exclusion limit at 95 150 GeV, while the expected exclusion range is below 136 GeV. The observed limit excludes at 95 Higgs boson decaying into two photons in the mass range 110 to 124 GeV and 128-136 GeV. The largest excess of events over the expected background is observed around 126 GeV. The excess has a local significance of 2.7 σ. When taking in consideration the look-elsewhere effect in the search range 100-150 GeV, the global significance is 1.2 σ. More data are required to ascertain the origin of this excess.
Search for rare decays of Z and Higgs bosons to J/ψ and a photon in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search is presented for decays of Z and Higgs bosons to a J/ψ meson and a photon, with the subsequent decay of the J/ψ to μ ^+μ ^- . The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 at √(s)=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The observed limit on the Z→J/ψγ decay branching fraction, assuming that the J/ψ meson is produced unpolarized, is 1.4× 10^-6 at 95% confidence level, which corresponds to a rate higher than expected in the standard model by a factor of 15. For extreme-polarization scenarios, the observed limit changes from -13.6 to +8.6
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H → ZZ^(*)→ 4l with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H->ZZ(*)->l+l-l+l-, where l=e,mu, is presented. Proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s)=7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponding to an average integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb-1 are compared to the Standard Model expectations. Upper limits on the production cross section of a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass between 110 and 600 GeV are derived. The observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit on the production cross section for a Higgs boson with a mass of 194 GeV, the region with the best expected sensitivity for this search, is 0.99 (1.01) times the Standard Model prediction. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass ranges 191-197, 199-200 and 214-224 GeV.
A search for Higgs boson pair production in the b b ττ final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. Results are presented from a search for production of Higgs boson pairs (HH) where one boson decays to a pair of b quarks and the other to a τ lepton pair. This work is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at √(s) = 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.3 fb^-1. Resonant and non-resonant modes of HH production have been probed and no significant excess relative to the background-only hypotheses has been found in either mode. Upper limits on cross sections of the two HH production modes have been set. The results have been combined with previously published searches at √(s) = 8 TeV, in decay modes to two photons and two b quarks, as well as to four b quarks, which also show no evidence for a signal. Limits from the combination have been set on resonant HH production by an unknown particle X in the mass range m_X = 300 GeV to m_X = 1000 GeV. For resonant production of spin 0 (spin 2) particles, the observed 95% CL upper limit is 1.13 pb (1.09 pb) at m_X = 300 GeV and to 21 fb (18 fb) at m_X = 1000 GeV. For non-resonant HH production, a limit of 43 times the rate predicted by the standard model has been set.
Search for associated production of a single top quark and a Higgs boson in events where the Higgs boson decays to two photons at √(s) = 8 TeV. We study the associated production of a single top quark and a Higgs boson, in order to directly constrain the top-Higgs coupling. Due to the destructive interference in the t-channel for standard model couplings, this process is very sensitive to both the magnitude and the sign of a non-standard top-Higgs coupling. We focus on the Higgs decay to two photons, that would be further enhanced in the scenario of a negative Yukawa coupling, and on the leptonic top decay channel. The analysis has an expected 95 The expected significance of the analysis is 1.2 standard deviations. Zero events are observed in the signal region, leading to a 95 of 4.1 times the expectation (with C_t = -1).
Updated results on the new boson discovered in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in the ZZ to 4 leptons channel in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. Measurements of the properties of the new boson recently observed at a mass near 125 GeV in the CMS experiment are reported. The results are obtained from a comprehensive search for the standard model Higgs boson in the H → ZZ decay channel, where both Z's decay to electron, muon, or tau lepton pairs. The search covers Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range 110 < m_H < 1000 GeV. The analysis uses pp collision data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb^-1 at √(s) = 7 TeV and 12.2 fb^-1 at √(s)= 8 TeV. The new boson is observed with a local significance above the expected background of 4.5 standard deviations. The signal strength μ, relative to the expectation for the standard model Higgs boson, is measured to be μ = 0.80^+ 0.35_-0.28 at 126 GeV. A measurement of its mass gives 126.2 ± 0.6 (stat) ± 0.2 (syst) GeV. The hypothesis 0^+ of the standard model for the spin J=0 and parity P=+1 quantum numbers is found to be consistent with the observation. Under the assumption that the observed boson has spin zero the data disfavor the pseudoscalar hypothesis 0^- with a CL_s value of 2.4
Search for resonant pair production of Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. A search for a narrow-width resonance decaying into two Higgs bosons, each having a mass of 125 GeV and decaying into a bb̅ pair, is presented. The search is performed using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 at √(s)=13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. No evidence for a signal is observed and upper limits at a 95
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons at LEP. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for the neutral Higgs bosons which are predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The data of the four collaborations are statistically combined and examined for their consistency with the background hypothesis and with a possible Higgs boson signal. The combined LEP data show no significant excess of events which would indicate the production of Higgs bosons. The search results are used to set upper bounds on the cross-sections of various Higgs-like event topologies. The results are interpreted within the MSSM in a number of “benchmark" models, including CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. These interpretations lead in all cases to large exclusions in the MSSM parameter space. Absolute limits are set on the parameter tanb and, in some scenarios, on the masses of neutral Higgs bosons.
Reconstruction and identification of boosted di-τ systems in a search for Higgs boson pairs using 13 TeV proton-proton collision data in ATLAS. In this paper, a new technique for reconstructing and identifying hadronically decaying Ï^+Ï^â pairs with a large Lorentz boost, referred to as the di-Ï tagger, is developed and used for the first time in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. A benchmark di-Ï tagging selection is employed in the search for resonant Higgs boson pair production, where one Higgs boson decays into a boosted bb pair and the other into a boosted Ï^+Ï^â pair, with two hadronically decaying Ï-leptons in the final state. Using 139 fb^â1 of proton-proton collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, the efficiency of the di-Ï tagger is determined and the background with quark- or gluon-initiated jets misidentified as di-Ï objects is estimated. The search for a heavy, narrow, scalar resonance produced via gluon-gluon fusion and decaying into two Higgs bosons is carried out in the mass range 1â3 TeV using the same dataset. No deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed, and 95% confidence-level exclusion limits are set on this model.[graphic not available: see fulltext]
Search for charged Higgs bosons using the OPAL detector at LEP.
Search for new light gauge bosons in Higgs boson decays to four-lepton final states in pp collisions at √(s)=8TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.. This paper presents a search for Higgs bosons decaying to four leptons via one or two light exotic gauge bosons Z_d, H→ Z Z_d → 4ℓ and H → Z_dZ_d → 4ℓ (ℓ=e or μ). The search is performed using pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 20 at the center-of-mass energy of √(s)=8TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The observed data are well described by the Standard Model prediction. Upper bounds at 95
Combined search for the Standard Model Higgs boson using up to 4.9 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A combined search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC using datasets corresponding to integrated luminosities from 1.04 fb-1 to 4.9 fb-1 of pp collisions collected at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV is presented. The Higgs boson mass ranges 112.9-115.5 GeV, 131-238 GeV and 251-466 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level (CL), while the range 124-519 GeV is expected to be excluded in the absence of a signal. An excess of events is observed around mH 126 GeV with a local significance of 3.5 standard deviations (sigma). The local significance of H -> gamma gamma, H -> ZZ(*) -> lll'l' and H -> WW(*) -> lvl'v, the three most sensitive channels in this mass range, are 2.8 sigma, 2.1 sigma and 1.4 sigma, respectively. The global probability for the background to produce such a fluctuation anywhere in the explored Higgs boson mass range 110-600 GeV is estimated to be 1.4% or, equivalently 2.2 sigma.
Search for charged Higgs bosons produced in association with a top quark and decaying via H^±→τν using pp collision data recorded at √(s) = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector. Charged Higgs bosons produced in association with a single top quark and decaying via H^±→τν are searched for with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, using proton–proton collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb^-1. The final state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic τ decay and missing transverse momentum, as well as a hadronically decaying top quark, resulting in the absence of high-transverse-momentum electrons and muons. The data are found to be consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. A statistical analysis leads to 95% confidence-level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction, σ(pp → [b]t H^±) ×(H^±→τν), between 1.9 pb and 15 fb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 200 to 2000 GeV. The exclusion limits for this search surpass those obtained with the proton–proton collision data recorded at √(s) = 8 TeV.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H to WW to lnujj decay channel in pp collisions at the LHC. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to two W bosons with the subsequent decay to a final state containing one lepton, one neutrino, and two jets is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=8 TeV and 5 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Selections to discriminate between the signal and background events are based on kinematic and topological quantities including the angular spin correlations between the decay products. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded in the mass ranges 215–490 GeV and 525–600 GeV at 95
Search for invisible decays of the Higgs boson produced in association with a hadronically decaying vector boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs boson decays to invisible particles is performed using 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The process considered is Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson (V = W or Z) that decays hadronically, resulting in events with two or more jets and large missing transverse momentum. No excess of candidates is observed in the data over the background expectation. The results are used to constrain VH production followed by H decaying to invisible particles for the Higgs mass range 115<m_H<300 GeV. The 95% confidence-level observed upper limit on σ_VH×BR(H→inv.) varies from 1.6 pb at 115 GeV to 0.13 pb at 300 GeV. Assuming Standard Model production and including the gg→ H contribution as signal, the results also lead to an observed upper limit of 78% at 95% confidence level on the branching ratio of Higgs bosons decays to invisible particles at a mass of 125 GeV.
Search for a Higgs boson decaying into a b-quark pair and produced in association with b quarks in proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV. A search for a neutral Higgs boson decaying to a pair of b quarks, and produced in association with at least one additional b quark, is presented. Multijet final states with three jets identified as originating from b quarks, at least one of which may include a non-isolated muon, are studied. The data used in this analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.7-4.8 inverse femtobarns, collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. This search is particularly sensitive to Higgs bosons in scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) with large values of tanβ. No excess over the predicted background from standard model processes is observed. Stringent upper limits on cross section times branching fraction are derived and interpreted as bounds in the MSSM tanβ and m_A parameter-space. Observed 95% confidence level upper limits reach as low as tanβ ≈ 18 for M_A ≈ 100 GeV.
Search for single production of vector-like quarks decaying to a b quark and a Higgs boson. A search is presented for single production of heavy vector-like quarks (B) that decay to a Higgs boson and a b quark, with the Higgs boson decaying to a highly boosted bb pair reconstructed as a single collimated jet. The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^â1. The data are consistent with background expectations, and upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the B quark cross section and the branching fraction are obtained in the range 1.28â0.07 pb, for a narrow B quark with a mass between 700 and 1800 GeV. The production of B quarks with widths of 10, 20 and 30% of the resonance mass is also considered, and the sensitivities obtained are similar to those achieved in the narrow width case. This is the first search at the CERN LHC for the single production of a B quark through its fully hadronic decay channel, and the first study considering finite resonance widths of the B quark.
Search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson or dark matter candidates produced in association with a Z boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson or dark matter candidates produced in association with a leptonically decaying Z boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV is presented. This search uses 36.1 fb^-1 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant deviation from the background expectation is observed. Assuming the Standard Model ZH production cross-section, an observed (expected) upper limit of 67% (39%) at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio of invisible decays of the Higgs boson with mass m_H = 125 GeV. The corresponding limits on the production cross-section of the ZH process with the invisible Higgs decays are also presented. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the dark matter candidate and mediator masses are reported in the framework of simplified dark matter models.
Combination of searches for Higgs boson pairs in pp collisions at √(s) =13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This letter presents a combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production using up to 36.1 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The combination is performed using six analyses searching for Higgs boson pairs decaying into the bbbb, bbWW, bbττ, WWWW, bbγγ and WWγγ final states. Results are presented for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. The combined observed limit at 95% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (κ_λ) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95% confidence level to -5.0 < κ_λ <12.0. In addition, limits are set on the production of narrow scalar resonances and spin-2 Kaluza-Klein Randall-Sundrum gravitons. Exclusion regions are also provided in the parameter space of the habemus Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and the Electroweak Singlet Model.
Search for the Higgs boson in events with isolated photons at LEP 2. A search for the Higgs boson in final states with one, two or three isolated photons has been performed based on data taken at LEP 2 by the DELPHI detector. The data analysed correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 67.5 pb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies of 161 GeV (9.7 pb^-1), 172 GeV (10.1 pb^-1) and 183 GeV (47.7 pb^-1). No evidence for the processes e^+ e^- → H γ with H→ bb̅ or γγ and e^+ e^- → Hqq̅ with H →γγ was observed. Model-independent limits on σ (e^+e^-→ Hγ)× BR(H→ bb̅), σ (e^+e^-→ Hqq̅)× BR(H→γγ) and σ (e^+e^-→ Hγ)× BR(H→γγ) are set, as well as model-dependent limits on Higgs boson anomalous couplings to vector bosons.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in the Ï+jets final state using 14.7 fbâ1 of pp collision data recorded at sâ=13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment. The experimental observation of charged Higgs bosons, HÂ±, which are predicted by several models with an extended Higgs sector, would indicate physics beyond the Standard Model. This note presents the results of a search for charged Higgs bosons in 14.7 fbâ1 of pp collision data at â s = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The search targets the Ï+jets channel in top-quark-associated H Â± production with a hadronically decaying W boson and Ï lepton in the final state. No evidence of a charged Higgs boson is found. For the mass range of mHÂ± = 200 â 2000 GeV, upper limits are set on the production cross section of the charged Higgs boson with the subsequent decay HÂ± â ÏÎ½ in a range of 2.0 â 0.008 pb.
Limits on Higgs boson masses from combining the data of the four LEP experiments at √(s)≤ 183 GeV.
Search for a heavy pseudoscalar boson decaying to a Z and a Higgs boson at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is presented for a heavy pseudoscalar boson A decaying to a Z boson and the standard model Higgs boson. In the final state considered, the Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark and antiquark, and the Z boson decays either into a pair of electrons, muons, or neutrinos. The analysis is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the background expectations. Exclusion limits are set in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models in the A boson mass range between 225 and 1000 GeV.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay mode H -> tau+ tau- -> ll + 4 neutrinos in Association with jets in Proton-Proton Collisions at sqrt(s) =7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a neutral Higgs boson as predicted by the Standard Model (SM) is presented based on proton-proton collisions at a nominal center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.06 fb-1. This search focuses on the decay mode Higgs-> tautau, where the two tau leptons decay leptonically, and the presence of at least one high transverse momentum hadronic jet. After signal selection, 46 events are observed in the >=1-jet data sample. The observed number of events is consistent with the total background estimate of 47 +/- 4 (stat) +6/-10 (syst) events. The results are interpreted in the context of the Standard Model and exclusion limits are derived as a function of m_H.
Search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson to a pair of new light bosons with two muon and two b jets in final states. We report the results of a search for exotic decays of a Higgs boson with m_h=125 GeV to a pair of new light bosons, a_1, where one of the light bosons decays to a pair of muons and the other one decays to a pair of b quarks. Such signatures are predicted in a number of well motivated extensions of the standard model, including the next-to-minimal supersymmetry and generic two Higgs doublet models with an additional scalar singlet. A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 recorded with the CMS detector in 2012 is exploited in μ^+μ^-bb final states where no statistically significant excess is observed with respect to the standard model backgrounds for different m_a_1 hypotheses above 25 GeV and below m_h/2. Upper limits are set on σ_ ggF× Br(h→μ^+μ^-bb) and on the branching ratio itself with former ranging between 4 to 12 fb, depending on the m_a_1 values. The limit on the branching ratio is Br(h→μ^+μ^-bb)<9× 10^-4 for the entire mass range.
Combined Measurement of the Higgs Boson Mass in pp Collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV with the ATLAS and CMS Experiments. A measurement of the Higgs boson mass is presented based on the combined data samples of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC in the H →γγ and H → ZZ→ 4ℓ decay channels. The results are obtained from a simultaneous fit to the reconstructed invariant mass peaks in the two channels and for the two experiments. The measured masses from the individual channels and the two experiments are found to be consistent among themselves. The combined measured mass of the Higgs boson is m_H = 125.09±0.21 (stat.)±0.11 (syst.) GeV.
Search for a light Higgs boson decaying to long-lived weakly-interacting particles in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the decay of a light Higgs (120 - 140 GeV) to a pair of weakly-interacting, long-lived particles in 1.94 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at sqrts = 7 TeV recorded in 2011 by the ATLAS detector is presented. The search strategy requires that both long-lived particles decay inside the muon spectrometer. No excess of events is observed above the expected background and limits on the Higgs boson production times branching ratio to weakly-interacting, long-lived particles are derived as a function of the particle proper decay length.
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to μ^+μ^- in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for neutral non-standard-model Higgs bosons decaying to two muons is presented. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, using proton-proton collisions data recorded by CMS at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The integrated luminosity is 35.9 fb^-1. The search is sensitive to neutral Higgs bosons produced via gluon fusion process or in association with a bb̅ quark pair. No significant deviation from the standard model expectation is observed. A 95
Search for charged Higgs bosons in WZ decays at 13 TeV. A search for heavy charged Higgs bosons decaying into W and Z bosons in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 and 12.9 fb^-1 collected with the CMS detector during 2015 and 2016, respectively. Events are selected with three leptons, electrons and muons, two jets with large rapidity separation and high dijet mass, and moderate missing transverse energy. The observation agrees with the standard model prediction. Limits on the charged Higgs boson cross section times branching fraction are given as a function of the charged Higgs boson mass and interpreted in the context of Higgs triplet models.
Search for Doubly Charged Higgs Bosons at LEP2. A search for pair-produced doubly charged Higgs bosons has been performed using the data collected by the DELPHI detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. No excess is observed in the data with respect to the Standard Model background. A lower limit for the mass of 97.3 GeV/c^2 at the 95
Constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings using production and decay information in the four-lepton final state. A search is performed for anomalous interactions of the recently discovered Higgs boson using matrix element techniques with the information from its decay to four leptons and from associated Higgs boson production with two quark jets in either vector boson fusion or associated production with a vector boson. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 38.6 inverse femtobarns. These data are combined with the data collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 inverse femtobarns, respectively. All observations are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson.
Properties of the observed Higgs-like resonance using the diphoton channel. Analyses are reported on properties of the recently discovered Higgs-like resonance around 125 GeV in its decay to two photons. The analyses are performed using the 2011 (2012) dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 (8) TeV. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 (19.6) fb^-1. The spin analysis is evaluated on the 2012 dataset alone. An upper limit on the natural width of the observed resonance is found to be 6.9 GeV at 95
Search for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bblνlν final state at √(s) = 13 TeV. Searches for resonant and non-resonant pair-produced Higgs bosons (hh) decaying respectively into bb and VV (with V either a W or a Z boson), with subsequent VV decays into two leptons and two neutrinos, are presented. The analyses are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb^-1. Data and predictions from the standard model are in agreement within uncertainties. For the standard model hh hypothesis, the data are observed (expected) to exclude a production cross-section times branching ratio of 72 (81^+42_-25) fb, corresponding to 79 (89^+47_-28) times the SM cross section. Lack of deviation from the SM predictions in the observations is used to place constraints on different scenarios considering anomalous couplings which could affect the rate and kinematics of hh production. In the case of resonant production of a new particle X, for mass hypotheses from m_X = 300 GeV to m_X = 900 GeV, the data are observed (expected) to exclude a production cross-section times branching ratio of narrow-width spin-0 particles from 434 to 17 (342^+135_-97 to 14^+6_-4)fb and narrow-width spin-2 particles from 448 to 14 (361^+140_-102 to 13^+5_-4)fb.
Evidence for the associated production of the Higgs boson and a top quark pair with the ATLAS detector. A search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (tt̅ H) in multilepton final states using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider is reported. Higgs boson decays to WW^*, ττ, and ZZ^* are targeted. Seven final states, categorised by the number and flavour of charged-lepton candidates, are examined for the presence of the Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV and a pair of top quarks. An excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed significance of 4.1 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 2.8 standard deviations. The best fit for the tt̅ H production cross section is σ(tt̅ H) = 790^+230_-210 fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 507^+35_-50 fb. The combination of this result with other tt̅ H searches from the ATLAS experiment using the Higgs boson decay modes to bb̅, γγ and ZZ^* → 4ℓ, has an observed significance of 4.2 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 3.8 standard deviations. This provides evidence for the tt̅ H production mode.
Search for Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to bb̅ at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. Several extensions of the Standard Model predict associated production of Dark Matter particles with a Higgs boson. Such processes are searched for in final states with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to a bb̅ pair with the ATLAS detector using 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC. The observed data are in agreement with the Standard Model and limits are placed on the associated production of Dark Matter particles and a Higgs boson for a simplified Dark Matter model and without extra model assumptions.
Search for lepton-flavour-violating decays of the Higgs boson to etau and emu at sqrt(s)=8 TeV. A direct search for lepton-flavour-violating decays of a Higgs boson (m_H = 125 GeV) is described. The search is performed for the H→eτ_μ, H→eτ_h, and H→eμ decays, where τ_h and τ_μ are taus reconstructed in the hadronic and muonic decay channels, respectively. The data sample used in the search corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 collected in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. No evidence is found for lepton-flavour-violating decays in either final state. For the H→eτ_μ and H→eτ_h channels, the sensitivity of the search is an order of magnitude better than the existing indirect limits. A constraint of B(H→eτ )<0.70 The limits onB(H →e τ)andB(H →e μ)are subsequently used to constrain the|Y_eτ|and|Y_eμ|Yukawa couplings.
Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson is performed using proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search targets the production of a Higgs boson via vector boson fusion. The data are found to be in agreement with the background contributions from standard model processes. An observed (expected) upper limit of 0.33 (0.25), at 95% confidence level, is placed on the branching fraction of the standard model Higgs boson decay to invisible particles. The result from this analysis is combined with the ones from other searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson performed using the 2016 data set. An observed (expected) upper limit of 0.26 (0.20), at 95% confidence level, is placed on the branching fraction of invisible decays of the Higgs boson, assuming standard model production rates. The combined expected result represents the most sensitive search for invisible decays of the Higgs boson to date. The result is also interpreted in the context of Higgs-portal dark matter models, in which upper bounds are placed on the spin-independent dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross section.
Search for Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons in the mu+mu- final state with the CMS experiment in pp Collisions at sqrt s =7 TeV. This paper presents a search for production of neutral Higgs bosons predicted by Supersymmetry using the μμ decay channel. The data from proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV were recorded in 2011 with the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.96 fb^-1. The search is sensitive to SUSY Higgs boson production in association with a bb̅ pair and via the gluon-gluon fusion process. In the m_h^max scenario, this analysis excludes values of tanβ between 16 and 26, at the
Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel with the full 2016 data set. Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson SM(125) in the H→γγ decay channel are reported. The analysis uses the data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions during the 2016 LHC running period. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 at √(s)=13 TeV. The measured signal strength relative to the standard model prediction is 1.16^+0.15_-0.14=1.16 ^+0.11_-0.10(stat.) ^+0.09_-0.08(syst.) ^+0.06_-0.05(theo.). Signal strengths associated with the different Higgs boson production mechanisms, coupling modifiers to bosons and fermions, and effective couplings to photons and gluons are also measured.
Search for vector boson fusion production of a massive resonance decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons in the four b quark final state at the HL-LHC using the CMS Phase 2 detector. The prospects of a search for a massive resonance produced through vector boson fusion and decaying to a pair of standard model Higgs bosons at the high luminosity LHC at CERN is explored. Simulated events from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV collected by the upgraded CMS detector are used. Both the Higgs bosons are assumed to decay to a b quark-antiquark pair, each. For a high mass resonance, the Higgs bosons are highly Lorentz-boosted and are each reconstructed as a large-area jet. The signal also contains two energetic jets in the forward regions of the detector. The expected signal significances for a bulk graviton in warped extradimensional models, having a mass between 1500 and 3000 GeV and a narrow width compared to its mass, is presented, assuming a cross section of 1 fb, for a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 ab^-1.
Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion at the High-Luminosity LHC. The search for a Higgs boson decaying to invisible particles, produced through the vector boson fusion mode in the High-Luminosity LHC proton-proton collisions at √(s)=14 TeV, is investigated based on simulation studies using Delphes, a fast-simulation package used to provide a parameterised response of the upgraded CMS detector. The event selection follows the existing CMS Run II data analysis, optimised for the High-Luminosity LHC conditions. The 95
Identification of boosted Higgs bosons decaying into b-quark pairs with the ATLAS detector at 13 TeV. This paper describes a study of techniques for identifying Higgs bosons at high transverse momenta decaying into bottom-quark pairs, H → bb̅, for proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV. These decays are reconstructed from calorimeter jets found with the anti-k_t R = 1.0 jet algorithm. To tag Higgs bosons, a combination of requirements is used: b-tagging of R = 0.2 track-jets matched to the large-R calorimeter jet, and requirements on the jet mass and other jet substructure variables. The Higgs boson tagging efficiency and corresponding multijet and hadronic top-quark background rejections are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. Several benchmark tagging selections are defined for different signal efficiency targets. The modelling of the relevant input distributions used to tag Higgs bosons is studied in 36 fb^-1 of data collected in 2015 and 2016 using g→ bb̅ and Z(→ bb̅)γ event selections in data. Both processes are found to be well modelled within the statistical and systematic uncertainties.
Analysis of the CP structure of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and τ leptons in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. The first measurement of the CP structure of the Yukawa coupling between the Higgs boson and τ leptons is presented. The measurement is based on data collected in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, 2017 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. Events are selected where one τ decays to a muon and the other hadronically, and where both τ leptons decay hadronically. These are the most sensitive decay modes for this analysis and together cover about 50
Constraints on the spin-parity and anomalous HVV couplings of the Higgs boson in proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV. The study of the spin-parity and tensor structure of the interactions of the recently discovered Higgs boson is performed using the H→ZZ, Zγ^*, γ^*γ^* → 4ℓ, H→WW→ℓνℓν, and H→γγ decay modes. The full dataset recorded by the CMS experiment during the LHC Run 1 is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 5.1 fb^-1 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and up to 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. A wide range of spin-two models is excluded at a 99% confidence level or higher, or at a 99.87% confidence level for the minimal gravity-like couplings, regardless of whether assumptions are made on the production mechanism. Any mixed-parity spin-one state is excluded in the ZZ and WW modes at a greater than 99.999% confidence level. Under the hypothesis that the resonance is a spin-zero boson, the tensor structure of the interactions of the Higgs boson with two vector bosons ZZ, Zγ, γγ, and WW is investigated and limits on eleven anomalous contributions are set. Tighter constraints on anomalous HVV interactions are obtained by combining the HZZ and HWW measurements. All observations are consistent with the expectations for the standard model Higgs boson with the quantum numbers J^PC=0^++.
Search for the neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in pp collisions at √(s)=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is reported. The analysis is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data were recorded in 2011 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^-1 to 4.8 fb^-1. Higgs boson decays into oppositely-charged muon or tau lepton pairs are considered for final states requiring either the presence or absence of b-jets. No statistically significant excess over the expected background is observed and exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are derived. The exclusion limits are for the production cross-section of a generic neutral Higgs boson, ϕ, as a function of the Higgs boson mass and for h/H/A production in the MSSM as a function of the parameters m_A and tanβ in the m_h^max scenario for m_A in the range of 90 GeV to 500 GeV.
Search for direct top squark pair production in events with a Higgs or Z boson, and missing transverse momentum in √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search for direct top squark pair production resulting in events with either a same-flavour opposite-sign dilepton pair with invariant mass compatible with a Z boson or a pair of jets compatible with a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson (h) is presented. Requirements on additional leptons, jets, jets identified as originating from b-quarks, and missing transverse momentum are imposed to target the other decay products of the top squark pair. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at √(s)=13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015–2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1. No excess is observed in the data with respect to the SM predictions. The results are interpreted in two sets of models. In the first set, direct production of pairs of lighter top squarks (t̃_1) with long decay chains involving Z or Higgs bosons is considered. The second set includes direct pair production of the heavier top squark pairs (t̃_2) decaying via t̃_2 → Z t̃_1 or t̃_2 → h t̃_1. The results exclude at 95% confidence level t̃_2 and t̃_1 masses up to about 800 GeV, extending the exclusion region of supersymmetric parameter space covered by previous LHC searches.
Search for the Higgs boson decaying to two muons in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for the Higgs boson decaying to two oppositely charged muons is presented using data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Data are found to be compatible with the predicted background. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09 GeV, the 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limit on the production cross section times branching fraction to a pair of muons is found to be 2.95 (2.45) times the standard model expectation. In combination with data recorded at center-of-mass energies √(s)= 7 and 8 TeV, the observed (expected) upper limit improves to 2.92 (2.16) times the standard model value. This corresponds to an upper limit on the standard model Higgs boson branching fraction to muons of 6.4 × 10^-4.
Measurements of the total cross sections for Higgs boson production combining the H →γγ and H → ZZ^* → 4ℓ decay channels at 7, 8 and 13 TeV center-of-mass energies with the ATLAS detector. Measurements of total cross sections are presented for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data correspond to 4.5 fb^-1 collected at the center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, 20.3 fb^-1 at 8 TeV, and most recently 3.2 fb^-1 at 13 TeV. Cross sections are obtained from measured H →γγ and H → ZZ^*→ 4ℓ event yields, which are combined accounting for detector effects, fiducial acceptances and branching fractions. The total Higgs boson production cross sections are measured to be 34^+11_-10 pb, 33.3^+5.8_-5.5 pb, and 24^+21_-18 pb for center-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV, respectively. These measurements are compared to state-of-the-art Standard Model theoretical predictions.
Evidence for Higgs Boson Decays to the τ^+τ^- Final State with the ATLAS Detector. A search for the Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV decaying into a pair of τ leptons is performed with a data sample of proton-proton collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of ℒ=20.3 fb^-1, collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=8 TeV. Final states in all τ decay combinations (both hadronic and leptonic) are examined. The observed (expected) deviation from the background-only hypothesis corresponds to a significance of 4.1 (3.2) standard deviations, and the measured signal strength is μ = 1.4 ^+0.5_-0.4. This is evidence for the existence of H→τ^+τ^- decays, consistent with the Standard Model expectation for a Higgs boson with m_H=125 GeV.
Sensitivity projections for Higgs boson properties measurements at the HL-LHC. The expected sensitivities of Higgs boson measurements at the High-Luminosity LHC with integrated luminosities of up to 3000 fb^-1 are presented. These are determined by the extrapolation of analyses of 13 TeV collision data, amounting to 35.9 fb^-1, collected during Run 2 of the LHC. Projections are given for a combined measurement of coupling modifiers and signal strengths, with additional studies for ttH and VH production with H→bb decay, and for production in association with a single top quark. Projections are also given for the measurement of the Higgs boson transverse momentum differential cross section, and expected constraints on anomalous couplings and the total width are determined using on- and off-shell H→ZZ measurements.
Search for Yukawa Production of a Light Neutral Higgs Boson at LEP. Within a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) a search for a light Higgs boson in the mass range of 4-12 GeV has been performed in the Yukawa process e+e- -> b bbar A/h -> b bbar tau+tau-, using the data collected by the OPAL detector at LEP between 1992 and 1995 in e+e- collisions at about 91 GeV centre-of-mass energy. A likelihood selection is applied to separate background and signal. The number of observed events is in good agreement with the expected background. Within a CP-conserving 2HDM type II model the cross-section for Yukawa production depends on xiAd = |tan beta| and xihd = |sin alpha/cos beta| for the production of the CP-odd A and the CP-even h, respectively, where tan beta is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets and alpha is the mixing angle between the neutral CP-even Higgs bosons. From our data 95% C.L. upper limits are derived for xiAd within the range of 8.5 to 13.6 and for xihd between 8.2 to 13.7, depending on the mass of the Higgs boson, assuming a branching fraction into tau+tau- of 100%. An interpretation of the limits within a 2HDM type II model with Standard Model particle content is given. These results impose constraints on several models that have been proposed to explain the recent BNL measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment.
Search for charged Higgs bosons with the H+ to tau nu decay channel in the fully hadronic final state at sqrt s = 8 TeV. A search for a charged Higgs boson is presented in the tt→H^±W^∓bb process for charged Higgs boson mass lighter than the mass difference of the top and bottom quarks and in the pp→t(b)H^+ and pp→t(b)H^- processes for charged Higgs boson mass heavier than the mass difference of the top and bottom quarks. The analysis concentrates on the H^+→τ^+ν_τ decay mode in a fully hadronic final state. The analysed data were recorded by the CMS experiment in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the CERN LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. The transverse mass of the tau and missing transverse energy system is exploited for separating the potential signal from the expected backgrounds. The mass spectrum observed in data is in agreement with the standard model prediction. Model-independent 95 with the modified frequentist CL_s criterion are established as 1.2–0.16 for m_H^+ in the range of 80 to 160 GeV and 0.38–0.026 pb on σ(pp→t(b)H^+)×ℬ(H^+→τ^+ν_τ) for m_H^+ in the range of 180 to 600 GeV.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in e^+ e^- Interactions at 161 ≤√(s)≤ 172 GeV. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson has been performed with the L3 detector at LEP. The data sample was collected at three centre-of-mass energies, 161.3, 170.3 and 172.3 GeV with integrated luminosities of 10.8, 1.0 and 9.2 pb^-1, respectively. No Higgs signal is observed. In combination with previous data taken at the Z resonance, a lower Higgs mass limit, M_H > 69.5 GeV, is obtained at 95
Search for associated production of dark matter with a Higgs boson decaying to bb or γγ at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for dark matter is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying either to a pair of bottom quarks or to a pair of photons. The data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. Results are interpreted in the context of a Z'-two-Higgs-doublet model, where the gauge symmetry of the standard model is extended to a U(1)[Z'] group, with a new massive Z' gauge boson, and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons. In this model, a high-mass resonance Z' decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light SM-like Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles. No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the m[Z']-m[A] phase space. For example, the observed data exclude the Z' mass range from 600 to 1860 GeV, for Z' coupling strength g[Z'] = 0.8, the coupling of A with dark matter particles g[chi] = 1, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan[beta] = 1, and m[A] = 300 GeV. The results of this analysis are valid for any dark matter particle mass below 100 GeV.
Search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top-quark pair. A search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair (tt̅H) is presented, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb^-1 and 19.7 fb^-1 collected in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV respectively. The search is based on the following signatures of the Higgs boson decay: H → hadrons, H → photons, and H → leptons. The results are characterized by an observed tt̅H signal strength relative to the standard model cross section, μ =σ/σ_SM, under the assumption that the Higgs boson decays as expected in the standard model. The best fit value is μ =2.8 ± 1.0 for a Higgs boson mass of 125.6 GeV.
Search for anomalous production of prompt same-sign lepton pairs and pair-produced doubly charged Higgs bosons with √(s) = 8 TeV pp collisions using the ATLAS detector. A low-background inclusive search for new physics in events with same-sign dileptons is presented. The search uses proton–proton collisions corresponding to 20.3 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity taken in 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Pairs of isolated leptons with the same electric charge and large transverse momenta of the type e^±e^±, e^±μ^±, and μ^±μ^± are selected and their invariant mass distribution is examined. No excess of events above the expected level of Standard Model background is found. The results are used to set upper limits on the cross sections for processes beyond the Standard Model. Limits are placed as a function of the dilepton invariant mass within a fiducial region corresponding to the signal event selection criteria. Exclusion limits are also derived for a specific model of doubly charged Higgs boson production.
Search for a new resonance decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the ℓℓ/ ℓν/ νν + b b̅ final states with the ATLAS Detector. A search for a new resonance decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the ℓℓ/ ℓν/ νν + b b̅ final states is performed using 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data recorded at √(s)= 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search is conducted by examining the WH/ZH invariant mass distribution for a localized excess. No significant deviation from the Standard Model background prediction is observed. The results are interpreted in terms of constraints on the Minimal Walking Technicolor model and on a simplified approach based on a phenomenological Lagrangian of Heavy Vector Triplets.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- collisions at √(s) = 130-172 GeV. A search is described to detect charged Higgs bosons via the process e^+e^- -> H^+H^-, using data collected by the OPAL detector at center-of-mass energies of 130-172 GeV with a total integrated luminosity of 25 pb^-1. The decay channels are assumed to be H^+ -> qq'(bar) and H^+ -> τ^+ ν_τ. No evidence for charged Higgs boson production is observed. The lower limit for its mass is determined to be 52 GeV at 95% confidence level, independent of the H^+ -> τ^+ ν_τ branching ratio.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in final states with charged leptons, neutrinos and b quarks at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for heavy resonances, decaying into the standard model vector bosons and the standard model Higgs boson, is presented. The final states considered contain a b quark-antiquark pair from the decay of the Higgs boson, along with electrons and muons and missing transverse momentum, due to undetected neutrinos, from the decay of the vector bosons. The mass spectra are used to search for a localized excess consistent with a resonant particle. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with background expectations. Exclusion limits are set in the context of spin-0 two Higgs doublet models, some of which include the presence of dark matter. In the spin-1 heavy vector triplet framework, mass-degenerate W' and Z' resonances with dominant couplings to the standard model gauge bosons are excluded below a mass of 2.9 TeV at 95% confidence level.
Combined measurement and interpretation of differential Higgs boson production cross sections at √(s)=13 TeV. The differential Higgs boson production cross sections are sensitive probes for new physics beyond the standard model. In particular, new physics may contribute in the gluon-gluon fusion loop, the dominant Higgs boson production mechanism at the LHC, and manifest itself as deviations from the expected standard model distributions. Combined spectra from the H→γγ, H→ ZZ and H→ bb̅ decay channels are presented, together with limits on the Higgs couplings using 35.9fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at √(s)=13TeV.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production cross section at 7, 8 and 13 TeV centre-of-mass energies and search for new physics at 13 TeV in the H → ZZ^* →ℓ^+ ℓ^â ℓ'^+ ℓ'^â final state with the ATLAS detector. Preliminary results for Higgs boson production in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS Collaboration in the decay channel H → ZZ^* →ℓ^+ ℓ^â ℓ'^+ ℓ'^â, where ℓ,ℓ^'=e or μ, are presented. These results are based on an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb^-1 collected in 2015 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The fiducial cross section after the selection cuts is reported as well as the total cross section, compared to new and updated results obtained at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, repectively. Dark matter production in association with a Higgs boson decaying to H → ZZ^* → 4ℓ is searched for in events with large missing transverse momentum. Moreover, a search for a heavy Higgs boson in the H → ZZ^* → 4ℓ channel is performed for the mass range 200 to 1000 GeV assuming a narrow intrinsic width.
Search for new phenomena in events with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying into two photons at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for new phenomena in events with missing transverse momentum and a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson decaying into two photons is presented. This study is based on data collected with the ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015 and 2016. No significant excess over the background expectation is observed. 95% confidence level limits are set on the production cross section times branching fraction of the SM Higgs boson decaying into two photons in association with missing transverse momentum in three different theoretical benchmark models. 95% confidence level limits are also set on the observed signal strength in a two-dimensional plane using masses of benchmark models particles. Additionally, the results are interpreted in terms of 90% confidence level limits on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section, as a function of the dark matter particle mass, for a spin-independent scenario.
Model independent search for Higgs boson pair production in the bbτ^+τ^- final state. Results of a search for the production of Higgs boson pairs are presented. In this search one Higgs boson decays to a pair of b-quarks, and the other Higgs boson decays to a tau lepton pair where the tau leptons decay hadronically. The search is based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at √(s) = 8 TeV in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.3 fb^-1. The resonant and the non-resonant productions of Higgs boson pairs are studied. No significant excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is observed in the data and therefore corresponding upper limits on cross section times branching ratio are set. In the case of resonant HH boson production, the limit on σ(pp→ X) ×BR(X →HH) for a resonance of spin 0 (spin 2) and mass m_X, ranges from 5.42 pb (3.97 pb) at m_X=300 GeV to 0.14 pb (0.14 pb) at m_X=1000 GeV. The limit on non-resonant production amounts to approximately 50 times the rate predicted by the SM.
Search for direct production of electroweakinos in final states with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying into photons in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a chargino-neutralino pair decaying via the 125 GeV Higgs boson into photons is presented. The study is based on the data collected between 2015 and 2018 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess over the expected background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level for a massless χ̃^0_1 are set on several electroweakino production cross-sections and the visible cross-section for beyond the Standard Model processes. In the context of simplified supersymmetric models, 95% confidence-level limits of up to 310 GeV in m(χ̃^±_1/χ̃^0_2), where m(χ̃^0_1)=0.5 GeV, are set. Limits at 95% confidence level are also set on the χ̃^±_1χ̃^0_2 cross-section in the mass plane of m(χ̃^±_1/χ̃^0_2) and m(χ̃^0_1), and on scenarios with gravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle. Upper limits at the 95% confidence-level are set on the higgsino production cross-section. Higgsino masses below 380 GeV are excluded for the case of the higgsino fully decaying into a Higgs boson and a gravitino.
Search for vector-like top quark partners produced in association with Higgs bosons in the diphoton final state. We present a search for a heavy vector-like quark with charge 2/3 (top partner, T). We search for events where the top partner is produced in pairs and where at least one of them decays into a top quark and a Higgs boson. We focus on the decays of the Higgs boson to photons to allow for full mass reconstruction. We select events with two photons and large hadronic activity, and we search for a resonance in the diphoton mass distribution. The observed data are in agreement with the standard model prediction. We proceed to set observed (expected) 95
Search for a Standard Model Higgs boson produced in the decay channel 4l. A search for a Higgs boson in the decay channel H→ ZZ^(*) with each Z boson decaying to an electron or muon pair is presented using pp collisions from the LHC at √(s) = 7 TeV. The data analyzed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.13 ± 0.07 fb^-1 recorded by the CMS detector in 2010 and 2011. The search covers Higgs boson mass (m_ H) hypotheses of 110 < m_ H < 600 with an expected sensitivity varying between one and five times the standard model cross section at 95 while 1.9± 0.1 background events are expected. The probability that the background fluctuates to the observed number of events is 1.3 The events are not clustered in mass excluding interpretation as the standard model Higgs boson. The distribution of events is consistent with the expectation of standard model continuum production of ZZ^(*) pairs and the production cross section for 60 < m_ Z < 120 is measured to be in agreement with the predicted value. Upper limits at 95
Search for Higgs boson decays into two new low-mass spin-0 particles in the 4b channel with the ATLAS detector using pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. This paper describes a search for beyond the Standard Model decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of new spin-0 particles subsequently decaying into b-quark pairs, H → aa → (bb̅)(bb̅), using proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV. This search focuses on the regime where the decay products are collimated and in the range 15 ≤ m_a ≤ 30 GeV and is complementary to a previous search in the same final state targeting the regime where the decay products are well separated and in the range 20 ≤ m_a ≤ 60 GeV. A novel strategy for the identification of the a → bb̅ decays is deployed to enhance the efficiency for topologies with small separation angles. The search is performed with 36 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected in 2015 and 2016 and sets upper limits on the production cross-section of H → aa → (bb̅)(bb̅), where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a Z boson.
Test of CP invariance in vector-boson fusion production of the Higgs boson in the H→ττ channel in proton–proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A test of CP invariance in Higgs boson production via vector-boson fusion in the H→ττ decay mode is presented. This test uses the Optimal Observable method and is carried out using 36.1 fb^-1 of √(s)=13 TeV proton–proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Contributions from CP-violating interactions between the Higgs boson and electroweak gauge bosons are described by an effective field theory, in which the parameter d̃ governs the strength of CP violation. No sign of CP violation is observed in the distributions of the Optimal Observable, and d̃ is constrained to the interval [-0.090, 0.035] at the 68% confidence level (CL), compared to an expected interval of d̃∈ [-0.035,0.033] based upon the Standard Model prediction. No constraints can be set on d̃ at 95% CL, while an expected 95% CL interval of d̃∈ [-0.21,0.15] for the Standard Model hypothesis was expected.
Flavour Independent h^0A^0 Search and Two Higgs Doublet Model Interpretation of Neutral Higgs Boson Searches at LEP. Upper limits on the cross-section of the pair-production process e+e- -> h0A0 assuming 100% decays into hadrons, are derived from a new search for the h0A0 -> hadrons topology, independent of the hadronic flavour of the decay products. Searches for the neutral Higgs bosons h0 and A0, are used to obtain constraints on the Type II Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM(11)) with no CP violation in the Higgs sector and no additional non Standard Model particles besides the five Higgs bosons. The analysis combines LEP1 and LEP2 data collected with the OPAL detctor up to the highest available centre-of-mass energies. The searches are sensitive to the h0, A0 -> qq, gg,tau+tau- and h0 -> A0A0 decay modes of the Higgs bosons. The 2HDM(II) parameter space is explored in a detailed scan. Large regions of the 2HDM(II) parameter space are excluded at the 95% CL in the (mh, mA), (mh, tanb) and (mA, tanb) planes, using both direct neutral Higgs boson searches and indirect limits derived from Standard Model high precision measurements. The region 1 lesssim mh lesssim 55 GeV and 3 lesssim mA lesssim 63 GeV is excluded at 95% CL independently of the choice of the 2HDM(II) parameters.
Searches for Higgs bosons in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV in the context of four-generation and fermiophobic models. Searches are reported for Higgs bosons in the context of either the standard model extended to include a fourth generation of fermions (SM4) with masses of up to 600 GeV or fermiophobic models. For the former, results from three decay modes (ττ, WW, and ZZ) are combined, whilst for the latter the diphoton decay is exploited. The analysed proton-proton collision data correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at 7 TeV and up to 5.3 inverse femtobarns at 8 TeV. The observed results exclude the SM4 Higgs boson in the mass range 110-600 GeV at 99% confidence level (CL), and in the mass range 110-560 GeV at 99.9% CL. A fermiophobic Higgs boson is excluded in the mass range 110-147 GeV at 95% CL, and in the range 110-134 GeV at 99% CL. The recently observed boson with a mass near 125 GeV is not consistent with either an SM4 or a fermiophobic Higgs boson.
Search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair in multi-lepton final states with the ATLAS detector. A search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair is performed in multi-lepton final states using 20.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at √(s)=8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. Five final states, targeting the decays H→ WW^*, ττ, and ZZ^*, are examined for the presence of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson: two same-charged light leptons (e or μ) without an additional hadronically decaying tau; three light leptons; two same-charged light leptons with an additional hadronically decaying tau; four light leptons; and one light lepton and two hadronically decaying taus. No significant excess of events is observed above the background expectation. The best fit for the tt̅ H production cross section, assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, is 2.1 ^+1.4_-1.2 times the SM expectation, and the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 4.7 (2.4) times the SM rate. The p-value for compatibility with the background-only hypothesis is 1.8σ; the expectation in the presence of a Standard Model signal is 0.9σ.
Combination of searches for Higgs boson pairs in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment.. This note presents a combination of searches for Higgs boson pairs using up to 36.1 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The combination is performed using three analyses searching for the HH → bb̅bb̅, HH → bb̅τ^+τ^- and HH → bb̅γγ decay channels. Results are presented for both non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. The combined observed (expected) limit on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair cross-section is 0.22 pb (0.35 pb) at 95
Projected performance of Higgs analyses at the HL-LHC for ECFA 2016. Projections of 13 TeV Higgs boson analyses to the High-Luminosity LHC conditions, with an integrated luminosity of up to 3000 fb^-1, are presented. The studies are performed under two scenarios, considering the systematic uncertainties in the present and in the High-Luminosity LHC conditions. The performance of H→ZZ, H→γγ, HH and beyond the standard model H→ττ, and H→invisible are shown.
Measurement of Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A measurement of the production processes of the recently discovered Higgs boson is performed in the two-photon final state using 5.4 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions data at √(s)=7 TeV and 20.3 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The number of observed Higgs boson decays to diphotons divided by the corresponding Standard Model prediction, called the signal strength, is found to be μ = 1.17 ± 0.27 at the value of the Higgs boson mass measured by ATLAS, m_H = 125.4 GeV. The analysis is optimized to measure the signal strengths for individual Higgs boson production processes at this value of m_H. They are found to be μ_ggF = 1.32 ± 0.38, μ_VBF = 0.8 ± 0.7, μ_WH = 1.0 ± 1.6, μ_ZH = 0.1 ^+3.7_-0.1, μ_tt̅H = 1.6 ^+2.7_-1.8, for Higgs boson production through gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, and in association with a W or Z boson or a top-quark pair, respectively. Compared with the previously published ATLAS analysis, the results reported here also benefit from a new energy calibration procedure for photons and the subsequent reduction of the systematic uncertainty on the diphoton mass resolution. No significant deviations from the predictions of the Standard Model are found.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in H- gt; tau tau decays in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson decaying into a pair of τ leptons is reported. The analysis, exploiting each of the , and final states, is based on data samples of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC and corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.6 and 13.0 at centre-of-mass energies of √(s)=7 and 8, respectively. The observed (expected) upper limit at 95
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons at LEP. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for the neutral Higgs bosons which are predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The data of the four collaborations are statistically combined and examined for their consistency with the background hypothesis and with a possible Higgs boson signal. The combined LEP data show no significant excess of events which would indicate the production of Higgs bosons. The search results are used to set upper bounds on the cross-sections of various Higgs-like event topologies. The results are interpreted within the MSSM in a number of “benchmark" models, including CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. These interpretations lead in all cases to large exclusions in the MSSM parameter space. Absolute limits are set on the parameter tanb and, in some scenarios, on the masses of neutral Higgs bosons.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson in the H → ZZ → l^+l^- τ^+ τ^- decay channel in pp collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. A search is reported for the standard model Higgs boson in the decay mode H to ZZ to tau plus lepton pairs, where the leptons are either electrons or muons, in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 inverse femtobarn collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. No evidence is found for a significant deviation from the background expectation. An upper limit four to twelve times larger than the predicted value is set at 95% confidence level for the product of the standard model Higgs boson production cross section and decay branching fraction in the mass range 190 < m(H) < 600 GeV.
Study of the spin and parity of the Higgs boson in diboson decays with the ATLAS detector. Studies of the spin, parity and tensor couplings of the Higgs boson in the H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ , H→ WW^* → eνμν and H→γγ decay processes at the LHC are presented. The investigations are based on 25 fb^-1 of pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at √( s) = 7 TeV and √( s )= 8 TeV. The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson hypothesis, corresponding to the quantum numbers J ^P=0^+, is tested against several alternative spin scenarios, including non-SM spin-0 and spin-2 models with universal and non-universal couplings to fermions and vector bosons. All tested alternative models are excluded in favour of the SM Higgs boson hypothesis at more than 99.9% confidence level. Using the H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ and H→ WW^* → eνμν decays, the tensor structure of the HVV interaction in the spin-0 hypothesis is also investigated. The observed distributions of variables sensitive to the non-SM tensor couplings are compatible with the SM predictions and constraints on the non-SM couplings are derived.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- collisions at √(s) = 181-184 GeV. Data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 181-184 GeV by ALEPH at LEP, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 56.9 pb^-1, are analysed in a search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons H+-. Three analyses are employed to select the tau nu tau nu, tau nu c s and c s c s final states. No evidence for a signal is found. Mass limits are set as a function of the branching fraction B( H+ -> tau+ nu ). Under the assumption that the decay modes considered cover the totality of the possible final states, charged Higgs bosons with masses below 59 GeV/c^2 are excluded at 95% C.L. independently of B( H+ -> tau+ nu ).
Search for Dark Matter in Events with Missing Transverse Momentum and a Higgs Boson Decaying to Two Photons in pp Collisions at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. Results of a search for new phenomena in events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to two photons are reported. Data from proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 have been collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The observed data are well described by the expected Standard Model backgrounds. Upper limits on the cross section of events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson candidate are also placed. Exclusion limits are presented for models of physics beyond the Standard Model featuring dark-matter candidates.
Search for lepton-flavour-violating decays of the Higgs boson. The first direct search for lepton-flavour-violating decays of the recently discovered Higgs boson (H) is described. The search is performed in the H →μτ_e and H →μτ_h channels, where τ_e and τ_h are tau leptons reconstructed in the electronic and hadronic decay channels, respectively. The data sample used in this search was collected in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 8 TeV with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. The sensitivity of the search is an order of magnitude better than the existing indirect limits. A slight excess of signal events with a significance of 2.4 standard deviations is observed. The p-value of this excess at M_H = 125 GeV is 0.010. The best fit branching fraction is ℬ(H →μτ )=(0.84^+0.39_-0.37)%. A constraint on the branching fraction, ℬ(H →μτ) less than 1.51% at 95% confidence level, is set. This limit is subsequently used to constrain the μ-τ Yukawa couplings to be less than 3.6× 10^-3.
Search for neutral Higgs bosons in CP-conserving and CP-violating MSSM scenarios. This report summarizes the final results from the OPAL collaboration on searches for neutral Higgs bosons predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). CP-conserving and for the first time at LEP CP-violating scenarios are studied. New scenarios are also included, which aim to set the stage for Higgs searches at future colliders. The results are based on the data collected with the OPAL detector at e+e- centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV. The data are consistent with the prediction of the Standard Model with no Higgs boson produced. Model-independent limits are derived for the cross-section of a number of events topologies motivated by prediction of the MSSM. Limits on Higgs boson masses and other MSSM parameters are obtained for a number of representative MSSM benchmark scenarios. For example, in the CP-conserving scenario mh-max where the MSSM parameters are adjusted to predict the largest range of values for mh at each tan beta, and for a top quark mass of 174.3 GeV, the domain 0.7<tan beta<1.9 is excluded at the 95% confidence level and Higgs boson mass limits of mh>84.5 GeV and ma>85.0 GeV are obtained. For the CP-violating benchmark scenario CPX which, by construction, enhances the CP-violating effects in the Higgs sector, the domain tan beta<2.8 is excluded but no universal limit can be set on the Higgs boson masses.

Search for bottom-squark pair production with the ATLAS detector in final states containing Higgs bosons, b-jets and missing transverse momentum. The result of a search for the pair production of the lightest supersymmetric partner of the bottom quark (b̃_1) using 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector is reported. In the supersymmetric scenarios considered both of the bottom-squarks decay into a b-quark and the second-lightest neutralino, b̃_1→ b + χ̃^0_2. Each χ̃^0_2 is assumed to subsequently decay with 100% branching ratio into a Higgs boson (h) like the one in the Standard Model and the lightest neutralino: χ̃^0_2→ h + χ̃^0_1. The χ̃^0_1 is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and is stable. Two signal mass configurations are targeted: the first has a constant LSP mass of 60 GeV; and the second has a constant mass difference between the χ̃^0_2 and χ̃^0_1 of 130 GeV. The final states considered contain no charged leptons, three or more b-jets, and large missing transverse momentum. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model background expectation is observed in any of the signal regions considered. Limits at the 95% confidence level are placed in the supersymmetric models considered, and bottom-squarks with mass up to 1.5 TeV are excluded.

A lower limit on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson of 107.0 GeV is set at the 95% confidence level.
Search for Lepton Flavour Violating Decays of the Higgs Boson in the mu-tau final state at 13 TeV.

The data sample used in the search was collected in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb^-1.

Measurements of the properties of the Higgs-like boson in the two photon decay channel with the ATLAS detector using 25 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. Measurements of the mass and couplings of the Higgs-like boson in the two photon decay channel with the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. The proton-proton collision datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.8 fb^-1 collected at √(s) = 7 TeV and 20.7 fb^-1 collected at √(s) = 8 TeV. The updated measurements benefit from an increased data sample and an improved analysis. The measured value of the mass of the Higgs-like boson is 126.8 ± 0.2 (stat) ± 0.7 (syst) GeV and the fitted number of signal events is found to be 1.65 ± 0.24 (stat) ^+0.25_-0.18 (syst) times the value predicted by the Standard Model. Measurements of the signal strengths in different production processes and a fiducial cross section for the observed particle are also presented.

Combination of SM Higgs Searches. The combination of results of searches for a Standard Model Higgs boson in five decay modes (γγ, bb, ττ, WW, and ZZ) performed by the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN, is presented. The search is performed for Higgs boson masses in the range of 110–600 GeV/c^2. The data correspond to an integrated total luminosity of up to 4.7 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. The expected exclusion range in the absence of the Standard Model Higgs boson is 117–543 GeV/c^2 at 95 the observed limits weaker than expected. To ascertain the origin of this excess, more data are required.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson in the H → ZZ → 2l 2ν channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. A search for the standard model Higgs boson in the H to ZZ to 2l 2nu decay channel, where l = e or mu, in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The data were collected at the LHC, with the CMS detector, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 inverse femtobarns. No significant excess is observed above the background expectation, and upper limits are set on the Higgs boson production cross section. The presence of the standard model Higgs boson with a mass in the 270-440 GeV range is excluded at 95% confidence level.
Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson in ATLAS. A direct search for evidence of decays to invisible particles of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented. This search is performed for a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson and having a mass between m_H=115 GeV and m_H=300 GeV. The results are interpreted to place limits on the branching fraction to invisible particles of the SM Higgs boson, where a non-zero invisible branching fraction could provide evidence for the production of dark matter particles. In addition, limits are set on any neutral Higgs-like particle, produced in association with a Z boson and decaying predominantly to invisible particles. No deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed in the search, which uses 4.7 fb^-1 of 7 TeV pp collision data and 13.0 fb^-1 of 8 TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Assuming the ZH production rate for a 125 GeV SM Higgs boson, an invisible branching fraction greater than 65% is excluded with a 95% confidence level for the observed, and 84% with 95% CL for the expected. Limits are also set on the cross section times invisible branching fraction of a possible additional Higgs-like boson over the mass range 115 GeV <m_H<300 GeV.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in the H^± → τ^±ν_τ decay channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is presented for charged Higgs bosons in the H^±→τ^±ν_τ decay mode in the hadronic final state and in final states with an electron or muon. The search is based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The results agree with the background expectation from the standard model. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching fraction to τ^±ν_τ for an H^± in the mass range of 80 GeV to 3 TeV, including the region near the top quark mass. The observed limit ranges from 6 pb at 80 GeV to 5 fb at 3 TeV. The limits are interpreted in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model m_h^mod- scenario.
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to tau+ tau- pairs in proton-proton collisions at sqrts = 7 TeV with the ATLAS Experiment. A search for neutral Higgs bosons A, H, h in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36, and focuses on Higgs decays into two τ leptons, , where one τ lepton decays leptonically and the other hadronically. After signal selection, 206 events are observed in this data sample. The observed number of events is consistent with the total background estimate of 195 ± 33 events, where the most important background contributions are obtained from data control samples. A 95
Search for Higgs Bosons in e^+ e^- Collisions at 183 GeV. The data collected by the OPAL experiment at sqrts=183 GeV were used to search for Higgs bosons which are predicted by the Standard Model and various extensions, such as general models with two Higgs field doublets and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 54pb-1. None of the searches for neutral and charged Higgs bosons have revealed an excess of events beyond the expected background. This negative outcome, in combination with similar results from searches at lower energies, leads to new limits for the Higgs boson masses and other model parameters. In particular, the 95% confidence level lower limit for the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson is 88.3 GeV. Charged Higgs bosons can be excluded for masses up to 59.5 GeV. In the MSSM, mh > 70.5 GeV and mA > 72.0 GeV are obtained for tanbeta>1, no and maximal scalar top mixing and soft SUSY-breaking masses of 1 TeV. The range 0.8 < tanb < 1.9 is excluded for minimal scalar top mixing and mtop < 175 GeV. More general scans of the MSSM parameter space are also considered.
Search for pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb̅bb̅ final state using proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs boson pair production in the bb̅bb̅ final state is carried out with up to 36.1 fb^-1 of LHC proton–proton collision data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. Three benchmark signals are studied: a spin-2 graviton decaying into a Higgs boson pair, a scalar resonance decaying into a Higgs boson pair, and Standard Model non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Two analyses are carried out, each implementing a particular technique for the event reconstruction that targets Higgs bosons reconstructed as pairs of jets or single boosted jets. The resonance mass range covered is 260–3000 GeV. The analyses are statistically combined and upper limits on the production cross section of Higgs boson pairs times branching ratio to bb̅bb̅ are set in each model. No significant excess is observed; the largest deviation of data over prediction is found at a mass of 280 GeV, corresponding to 2.3 standard deviations globally. The observed 95% confidence level upper limit on the non-resonant production is 13 times the Standard Model prediction.
Search for direct production of electroweakinos in final states with one lepton, missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying into two b-jets in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The results of a search for electroweakino pair production pp →χ̃^±_1 χ̃^0_2 in which the chargino (χ̃^±_1) decays into a W boson and the lightest neutralino (χ̃^0_1), while the heavier neutralino (χ̃^0_2) decays into the Standard Model 125 GeV Higgs boson and a second χ̃^0_1 are presented. The signal selection requires a pair of b-tagged jets consistent with those from a Higgs boson decay, and either an electron or a muon from the W boson decay, together with missing transverse momentum from the corresponding neutrino and the stable neutralinos. The analysis is based on data corresponding to 139 fb^-1 of √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions provided by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded by the ATLAS detector. No statistically significant evidence of an excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is found. Limits are set on the direct production of the electroweakinos in simplified models, assuming pure wino cross-sections. Masses of χ̃^±_1/χ̃^0_2 up to 740 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a massless χ̃^0_1.
Constraints on the Higgs boson self-coupling from ttH+tH, H to gamma gamma differential measurements at the HL-LHC. This note details a study of prospects for ttH+tH, H→γγ differential cross section measurements at the HL-LHC with the CMS Phase-2 detector. The study is performed using simulated proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=14 TeV, corresponding to 3 ab^-1 of data. The expected performance of the upgraded CMS detector is used to model the object reconstruction efficiencies under HL-LHC conditions. The results are interpreted in terms of the expected sensitivity to deviations of the Higgs boson self-coupling, κ_λ, from beyond standard model effects. Using the HL-LHC data, the precision expected in ttH+tH, H→γγ differential cross section measurements will constrain κ_λ within the range -4.1<κ_λ<14.1, at the 95This document has been revised with respect to the version dated November 19, 2018.
Search for pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb̅bb̅ final state using proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs-boson pair production in the bb̅bb̅ final state is carried out with 3.2 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The data are consistent with the estimated background and are used to set upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio to bb̅bb̅ for Kaluza-Klein gravitons in the context of the Randall–Sundrum model with a warped extra dimension and for a model with a narrow spin-0 resonance. In the context of the Randall–Sundrum model, upper limits of ∼70 fb are obtained over a broad mass range of 600 and 3000 GeV, at the 95% confidence level. The production cross section times branching ratio for non-resonant Higgs-boson pairs is also constrained to be less than 1.22 pb.

Constraints on Higgs boson properties using WW^*(→ eνμν) jj production in 36.1 fb^-1 of √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. This note presents the results of two studies of Higgs boson properties using the WW^*(→ eνμν)jj final state, based on a dataset corresponding to 36.1 fb^-1 of √(s)=13 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The first study targets Higgs boson production via gluon fusion and constrains the CP properties of the effective Higgs-gluon vertex for the first time in the eνμν jj final state. Using both angularÂ distributionsÂ and the overall rate,Â theÂ ratio of the CP-odd to CP-even coupling strength scale factors of the effective Higgs-gluon vertex is constrainedÂ toÂ κ_Agg/κ_Hgg = 0.0 ± 0.4 (stat.) ± 0.3 (syst.). The second study investigates vector boson fusion to individually access the Higgs boson couplings to longitudinally and transversely polarised W and Z bosons in both the production and the decay of the Higgs boson; these polarisations have not been previously constrained in this process. The polarisation coupling-strength scale factors, defined as the ratios of the measured polarisation-dependent coupling strengths to those predicted by the Standard Model, are constrained using shape and rate information to the values a_L=0.91^+0.10_-0.18(stat.)^+0.09_-0.18(syst.) and a_T=1.16 ± 0.4(stat.)^+0.4_-0.3(syst.). These coupling strengths are translated into pseudo-observables, resulting in κ_VV=0.90^+0.10_-0.18(stat.)^+0.09_-0.16(syst.) and ϵ_VV =0.13^+0.28_-0.20 (stat.)^+0.08_-0.10(syst.). All results are consistent with the SM predictions.
Search for direct production of electroweakinos in final states with missing transverse energy and a Higgs boson decaying into photons in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a chargino-neutralino pair decaying via the 125 GeV Higgs boson into photons is presented. This study is based on the full Run 2 data collected between 2015 and 2018 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess over the expected background is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level for a massless χ̃^0_1 are set on several electroweakino production cross sections and the visible cross section for beyond the Standard Model physics processes. In the context of simplified supersymmetric models, 95% confidence-level limits of up to 315 GeV in m(χ̃^±_1/χ̃^0_2), where m(χ̃^0_1) is 0.5 GeV, are set. Limits at 95% confidence level are also set on the χ̃^±_1χ̃^0_2 cross section in the mass plane of m(χ̃^±_1/χ̃^0_2) and m(χ̃^0_1).
Search for the Flavor-Changing Neutral Current Decay t→ qH Where the Higgs Decays to b b Pairs at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for the flavor-changing neutral current Higgs (FCNH) process in top quark decays, t→ qH (q = u, c), is presented using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.8 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis is performed by tagging a top quark decaying into a bottom quark and a W boson, identified with a lepton and a neutrino, and searching for a b b pair from the Higgs decay and a light quark in the event. No significant excess is observed over the background prediction. The branching fraction upper limits for t→ qH are determined to be B( t→ cH) < 1.16
Summary results of high mass BSM Higgs searches using CMS run-I data. Exclusion contours are presented summarizing several searches for additional heavy Higgs bosons in physics models beyond the SM that have been performed with the CMS detector on the full LHC run-1 dataset collected during the years 2011 and 2012. The interpretation is restricted to two benchmark scenarios of the Two Higgs Doublet Model and two benchmark scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric SM.
Search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair in multilepton final states with the ATLAS detector. A search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair is performed in multilepton final states using 20.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at √(s)=8 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. Five final states, targeting the decays H→ WW^*, ττ, and ZZ^*, are examined for the presence of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson: two same-charge light leptons (e or μ) without a hadronically decaying τ lepton; three light leptons; two same-charge light leptons with a hadronically decaying τ lepton; four light leptons; and one light lepton and two hadronically decaying τ leptons. No significant excess of events is observed above the background expectation. The best fit for the tt̅ H production cross section, assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, is 2.1 ^+1.4_-1.2 times the SM expectation, and the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 4.7 (2.4) times the SM rate. The p-value for compatibility with the background-only hypothesis is 1.8σ; the expectation in the presence of a Standard Model signal is 0.9σ.

The tau leptons are reconstructed in the leptonic and hadronic decay modes. No significant excess over the standard model background expectation is observed. The observed (expected) upper limits on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson are found to be ℬ(H→μτ)<0.25(0.25)

The final state considered is particularly sensitive to signatures of a Higgs sector beyond the standard model, as predicted by the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with large values of the parameter tanβ. No signal above the standard model background expectation is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are set for Higgs bosons with masses up to 1300 GeV at 95
Search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson to μτ and eτ in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson in the Î¼Ï and eÏ decay modes is presented. The search is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^â1 of proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector in 2016, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess over the standard model expectation is observed. The observed (expected) upper limits on the lepton flavour violating branching fractions of the Higgs boson are â¬(HâââÎ¼Ï)Â <â0.25%Â (0.25%) and â¬(HâââeÏ)â<â0.61%â(0.37%), at 95% confidence level. These results are used to derive upper limits on the off-diagonal Î¼Ï and eÏ Yukawa couplings √(|Y_μτ|^2+|Y_τμ|^2)<1.43×10^-3 and √(|Y_eτ|^2+|Y_τe|^2)<2.26×10^-3 at 95% confidence level. The limits on the lepton flavour violating branching fractions of the Higgs boson and on the associated Yukawa couplings are the most stringent to date.
Search for Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs Bosons H/A in the ττ final state in up to 13.3 fb^â1 of pp collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. A search for neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 13.3 fb^-1 from proton–proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to a ττ pair with at least one τ lepton decaying hadronically. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2-1.2 TeV. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model, hence results are given as upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction as a function of the Higgs boson mass. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios. The most stringent MSSM parameter space constraints from the search exclude at 95% confidence level tanβ > 9 for m_A = 200 and tanβ > 50 for m_A = 1200 in the m_h^mod+ MSSM scenario.

The search is performed in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 inverse femtobarns, recorded by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. No significant excess of events above the expectation from background is observed. Upper limits on the VH production cross section times the H to b-quark pair branching ratio, with respect to the expectations for a standard model Higgs boson, are derived for a Higgs boson in the mass range 110-135 GeV. In this range, the observed 95% confidence level upper limits vary from 3.4 to 7.5 times the standard model prediction; the corresponding expected limits vary from 2.7 to 6.7.

This document summarises the baseline boosted Higgs boson identification strategy for Run 2 data collected by the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 13 TeV, as updated for the analysis of the 2015 and 2016 data. Boosted H→ bb̅ decays are reconstructed from jets found with the anti-k_t R = 1.0 jet algorithm, that are trimmed using a subjet radius of R_subjet = 0.2 and a minimum transverse momentum fraction of f_cut = 5
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H to WW to lvjj decay channel. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to two W bosons with the subsequent decay to a final state containing one lepton, one neutrino, and two jets is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.1 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=8 TeV and collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2012. Selections to discriminate between the signal and background events are based on kinematic and topological quantities including the angular spin correlations between the decay products. No evidence for the Higgs boson is found. Using 8 TeV data, we exclude the Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range 260–460 GeV at 95 230-480 GeV at 95
Search for a light charged Higgs boson in top quark decays in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. Results are presented on a search for a light charged Higgs boson that can be produced in the decay of the top quark to charged H and b quark and which, in turn, decays into tau and tau neutrino. The analysed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 2 inverse femtobarns recorded in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is sensitive to the decays of the top quark pairs t anti-t to charged Higgs W b anti-b and t anti-t to charged Higgs b anti-b. Various final states have been studied separately, all requiring presence of a tau lepton from charged Higgs decays, missing transverse energy, and multiple jets. Upper limits on the branching fraction B(t to charged Higgs b) in the range of 2-3% are established for charged Higgs boson masses between 80 and 160 GeV, under the assumption that B(charged Higgs to tau anti-tau) = 1.
Search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson in the diphoton channel with the ATLAS detector. The search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson in the diphoton channel with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV is performed using an integrated luminosity of 1.08/fb recorded in 2011. A specific benchmark model is considered where all the fermion couplings to the Higgs boson are set to zero and the bosonic couplings are kept at the Standard Model values. No significant excess is observed in the diphoton mass distribution and limits are set using a modified frequentist method (CLs). The expected exclusion at 95% CL covers the Higgs boson mass range from 110 GeV to 116 GeV, while the observed limits are set in the ranges 110 – 111 GeV and 113.5 – 117.5 GeV.
Evidence for the Higgs boson decay to a bottom quark-antiquark pair.

The search is performed in data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fbâ1 at s=13TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC during Run 2 in 2016. An excess of events is observed in data compared to the expectation in the absence of a Hâbbâ¾ signal. The significance of this excess is 3.3 standard deviations, where the expectation from SM Higgs boson production is 2.8. The signal strength corresponding to this excess, relative to that of the SM Higgs boson production, is 1.2Â±0.4 . When combined with the Run 1 measurement of the same processes, the signal significance is 3.8 standard deviations with 3.8 expected. The corresponding signal strength, relative to that of the SM Higgs boson, is 1.06â0.29+0.31 .
Search for a Standard Model Higgs Boson in the Mass Range 200-600 GeV in the Channels H -> ZZ -> llnunu and H -> ZZ -> llqq with the ATLAS Detector. This note summarizes preliminary results on the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range between 200 GeV and 600 GeV in the channels H -> ZZ -> llnunu and H -> ZZ -> llqq. A Higgs boson in this mass range could be observed or excluded with of the order of a fb^-1 of LHC data. No evidence for the production of a Higgs boson is observed in a dataset of pp collisions corresponding to approximately 35 pb^-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2010. Upper limits on the Higgs-boson production cross-sections are presented.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with W and Z bosons in pp collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. A search for the Higgs boson produced in association with a W or Z boson in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is performed with the CMS detector at the LHC using the full 2011 data sample, from an integrated luminosity of 5 inverse femtobarns. Higgs boson decay modes to tau tau and WW are explored by selecting events with three or four leptons in the final state. No excess above the standard model expectation is observed, resulting in exclusion limits on the product of Higgs associated production cross section and decay branching fraction for Higgs boson masses between 110 and 200 GeV in these channels. Combining these results with other CMS associated production searches using the same dataset in the H →γγ and H → bb̅ decay modes, the cross section for associated Higgs boson production 3.3 times the standard model expectation or larger is ruled out at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.
Measurement of the associated production of a Higgs boson decaying into b-quarks with a vector boson at high transverse momentum in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The associated production of a Higgs boson with a W or Z boson decaying into leptons and where the Higgs boson decays to a bb̅ pair is measured in the high vector-boson transverse momentum regime, above 250 GeV, with the ATLAS detector. The analysed data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1, were collected in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 13 TeV. The measured signal strength, defined as the ratio of the measured signal yield to that predicted by the Standard Model, is 0.72 ^+0.39_-0.36 corresponding to an observed (expected) significance of 2.1 (2.7) standard deviations. Cross-sections of associated production of a Higgs boson decaying into b quark pairs with a W or Z gauge boson, decaying into leptons, are measured in two exclusive transverse momentum regions, 250-400 GeV and above 400 GeV, and interpreted as constraints on anomalous couplings in the framework of a Standard Model effective field theory.
Search for a fermiophobic Higgs at LEP 2. Higgs bosons predicted by the fermiophobic scenario within Two Higgs Doublets Models were searched for in the data collected by the DELPHI detector at centre-of-mass energies between 189 GeV and 202 GeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 380 pb^-1. No signal was found and confidence limits were derivedwska, Agni
Measurements of Higgs boson production and couplings in diboson final states with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Measurements are presented of production properties and couplings of the recently discovered Higgs boson using the decays into boson pairs, H →γγ, H → ZZ* → 4l and H → WW* → lν lν. The results are based on the complete pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at centre-of-mass energies of √(s)=7 and √(s)=8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 25 fb^-1. Evidence for Higgs boson production through vector-boson fusion is reported. Results of combined fits probing Higgs boson couplings to fermions and bosons, as well as anomalous contributions to loop-induced production and decay modes, are presented. All measurements are consistent with expectations for the Standard Model Higgs boson.
Limits on a light Higgs boson in e+e- collisions at LEP.
Combined results of searches for the standard model Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. Combined results are reported from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV in five Higgs boson decay modes: gamma pair, b-quark pair, tau lepton pair, W pair, and Z pair. The explored Higgs boson mass range is 110-600 GeV. The analysed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6-4.8 inverse femtobarns. The expected excluded mass range in the absence of the standard model Higgs boson is 118-543 GeV at 95% CL. The observed results exclude the standard model Higgs boson in the mass range 127-600 GeV at 95% CL, and in the mass range 129-525 GeV at 99% CL. An excess of events above the expected standard model background is observed at the low end of the explored mass range making the observed limits weaker than expected in the absence of a signal. The largest excess, with a local significance of 3.1 sigma, is observed for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 124 GeV. The global significance of observing an excess with a local significance greater than 3.1 sigma anywhere in the search range 110-600 (110-145) GeV is estimated to be 1.5 sigma (2.1 sigma). More data are required to ascertain the origin of this excess.
Search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs in pp collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. A search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is performed using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 inverse femtobarns recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is sensitive to both the standard model Higgs boson and to the neutral Higgs bosons predicted by the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM). No excess of events is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. For a standard model Higgs boson in the mass range of 110-145 GeV upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the production cross section are determined. We exclude a Higgs boson with m(H)=115 GeV with a production cross section 3.2 times of that predicted by the standard model. In the MSSM, upper limits on the neutral Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, m(A), sets stringent new bounds in the parameter space, excluding at 95% CL values of tan(beta) as low as 7.1 at m(A) = 160 GeV.
Search for nonresonant Higgs boson pair production in the bb̅bb̅ final state at √(s) = 13 TeV. Results of a search for nonresonant production of Higgs boson pairs, with each Higgs boson decaying to a bb̅ pair, are presented. This search uses data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, collected by the CMS detector at the LHC. No signal is observed, and a 95% confidence level upper limit of 847 fb is set on the cross section for standard model nonresonant Higgs boson pair production times the squared branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay to a bb̅ pair. The same signature is studied, and upper limits are set, in the context of models of physics beyond the standard model that predict modified couplings of the Higgs boson.
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons decaying into a pair of bottom quarks. A search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into a b b̅ quark pair and produced in association with at least one additional b quark is presented. This signature is sensitive to the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with large values of the parameter tanβ. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. The results are combined with a previous analysis based on 7 TeV data. No signal is observed. Stringent upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction are derived for Higgs bosons with masses up to 900 GeV, and the results are interpreted within different MSSM benchmark scenarios, m_h^max, m_h^mod+, m_h^mod-, light-stau and light-stop. Observed 95% confidence level upper limits on tanβ, ranging from 14 to 50, are obtained in the m_h^mod+ benchmark scenario.
Search for a standard model like Higgs boson in the decay channel H to ZZ to l+l- q qbar at CMS. A search for a standard model like Higgs boson decaying to two Z bosons with subsequent decay to a final state containing two leptons and two quark-jets, H→ ZZ →ℓ^+ℓ^- qq̅, is presented. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=8 TeV and collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analysis exploits the kinematic information and the flavor tagging of the leading particles in the event for detecting candidate signals from a Higgs-like boson in the mass range from 230 GeV/c^2 to 600 GeV/c^2. No evidence for such a boson is found, resulting in upper limits on the production cross section.
A search for resonances decaying into a Higgs boson and a new particle X in the XH → qqbb final state with the ATLAS detector. A search for heavy resonances decaying into a Higgs boson ( H ) and a new particle ( X ) is reported, utilizing 36.1 fb â1 of protonâproton collision data at s=13TeV collected during 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The particle X is assumed to decay to a pair of light quarks, and the fully hadronic final state XHâqqÂ¯â²bbÂ¯ is analysed. The search considers the regime of high XH resonance masses, where the X and H bosons are both highly Lorentz-boosted and are each reconstructed using a single jet with large radius parameter. A two-dimensional phase space of XH mass versus X mass is scanned for evidence of a signal, over a range of XH resonance mass values between 1 TeV and 4 TeV, and for X particles with masses from 50 GeV to 1000 GeV. All search results are consistent with the expectations for the background due to Standard Model processes, and 95% CL upper limits are set, as a function of XH and X masses, on the production cross-section of the XHâqqÂ¯â²bbÂ¯ resonance.
Final results from DELPHI on the searches for SM and MSSM Neutral Higgs bosons. These final results from DELPHI searches for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, together with benchmark scans of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) neutral Higgs bosons, used data taken at centre-of-mass energies between 200 and 209 GeV with a total integrated luminosity of 224 pb^-1. The data from 192 to 202 GeV are reanalysed with improved b-tagging for MSSM final states decaying to four b-quarks. The 95% confidence level lower mass bound on the Standard Model Higgs boson is 114.1 GeV/c2. Limits are also given on the lightest scalar and pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons of the MSSM.
Search for Higgs Boson Production in pp Collisions at sqrts=7 TeV using the H->WW->lvqq Decay Channel and the ATLAS Detector. A search for the Higgs boson in the H->WW->lvqq decay mode has been performed using 35 pb^-1 of 7 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS detector during the 2010 run of the LHC. Since no significant excess is observed over the expected background, limits on the Higgs production cross section are derived for masses between mH=200 GeV and mH=600 GeV. For a Higgs boson mass mH=400 GeV, the 95% confidence level upper bound on the cross-section for Higgs boson production by gluon fusion times the branching ratio for H->WW is 13.6 pb, or approximately 11.5 times the Standard Model prediction.
A Search for a light charged Higgs boson decaying to cs Ì in pp collisions at âs = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. We present the search results for a light charged Higgs boson produced in top quark decays and decaying into two jets in pp collisions at âs = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detec- tor. The analysis uses a data sample collected during 2010, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pbâ1. The search is based on the semi-leptonic decay channel of tt Ì candi- dates and analyzes the invariant mass distribution of two jets in the final state. The data are found to be in good agreement with the expectation from the Standard Model background processes and 95% upper limits are set on the decay branching ratio of top quarks to charged Higgs bosons that decay into cs Ì/c Ìs.
Search for the neutral Higgs boson at LEP.

The reconstruction of tracks, leptons, photons, missing energy and jets is investigated, together with the performance of b-tagging and the trigger. The physics potential for a variety of interesting physics processes, within the Standard Model and beyond, is examined. The study comprises a series of notes based on simulations of the detector and physics processes, with particular emphasis given to the data expected from the first years of operation of the LHC at CERN.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in hadronic final states with 2016 data. A search for heavy resonances with a mass above 1 TeV, decaying to a vector boson and a Higgs boson is presented. The search considers hadronic decays of the vector boson, and Higgs boson decays to b quarks. The collimated pair of quarks are reconstructed as a single massive jet. The analysis is performed using a data sample collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The data is found to be consistent with the background expectation and used to place limits in the context of a theoretical model with a heavy vector triplet. In the benchmark scenario model B, a resonance with mass up to 3.4 TeV is excluded at 95
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with W or Z bosons, and decaying to bottom quarks for ICHEP 2012. A search for the standard model Higgs boson (H) decaying to when produced in association with a weak vector boson (V) is reported for the following modes: W(μν)H, W(eν)H, Z(μμ)H, Z(ee)H and Z(νν)H. The search is performed in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb^-1, recorded by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 7during 2011, and in a data sample of up to 5.1 fb^-1 of 8collisions during 2012. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is observed. Upper limits on the VH production cross section times the → branching ratio, with respect to the expectations for a standard model Higgs boson, are derived for a Higgs boson in the mass range 110–135. In this range, the observed 95
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H → ZZ^(*)→ 4ℓ with 4.8 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H→ ZZ^(â)→ l+lâl'+l'â, where l,l' = e,μ, is presented. Proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponding to an average integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb^â1 are compared to the Standard Model background expectations. Upper limits on the production cross section of a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass between 110 GeV and 600 GeV are derived. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass ranges 135 GeV â 156 GeV, 181 GeV â 234 GeV and 255 GeV â 415 GeV. The largest deviations from the background expectation are observed for m_H = 125 GeV with a p_0-value of 1.8%, m_H = 244 GeV with a p_0-value of 1.1% and m_H = 500 GeV with a p_0-value of 1.4%. Once the look-elsewhere effect is considered, none of these excesses is significant by itself.
Determination of the off-shell Higgs boson signal strength in the high-mass ZZ final state with the ATLAS detector. The measurement of the ZZ final state in the mass range above the 2m_Z threshold provides a unique opportunity to measure the off-shell coupling strength of the observed Higgs boson. In this note a determination of the off-shell Higgs boson signal strength in the ZZ → 4ℓ and ZZ→ 2ℓ 2ν final states is presented. The result is based on the data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 at a collision energy of √(s) = 8 TeV. The 95% confidence level upper CLs limit on the off-shell signal strength μ_ off-shell is in the range 5.6â9.0 when varying the unknown gg → ZZ background K-factor from higher-order QCD corrections between half and twice the known signal K-factor, with an expected range of 6.6â10.7. Assuming no energy-scale dependence of the relevant Higgs boson couplings, a combination with the on-shell measurement of μ_ on-shell in the H → ZZ → 4ℓ channel yields an observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit on Γ_H/Γ_H^SM in the range 4.8â7.7 (7.0â12.0) under the same variations of the background K-factor.
Test of CP Invariance in vector-boson fusion production of the Higgs boson using the Optimal Observable method in the ditau decay channel with the ATLAS detector. A test of CP invariance in Higgs boson production via vector-boson fusion using the method of the Optimal Observable is presented. The analysis exploits the decay mode of the Higgs boson into a pair of τ leptons and is based on 20.3 fb^-1 of protonâproton collision data at √(s) = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Contributions from CP-violating interactions between the Higgs boson and electroweak gauge bosons are described in an effective field theory framework, in which the strength of CP violation is governed by a single parameter d̃. The mean values and distributions of CP-odd observables agree with the expectation in the Standard Model and show no sign of CP violation. The CP-mixing parameter d̃ is constrained to the interval [-0.11,0.05] at 68% confidence level, consistent with the Standard Model expectation of d̃=0.
Search for the charged Higgs boson in Z0 decay.
Search for the Higgs boson in the WW(*) decay channel with the CMS experiment. An analysis for the prospective search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson with the CMS experiment is presented. The search strategy is based on the inclusive production of Higgs bosons, which decay to a pair of W bosons. The leptonic final states (e and μ) of the W bosons provide a good signature for the Higgs boson, allowing the isolation of a sample of events rich in signal. Signal and background samples are generated with a detailed simulation of the detector response and the complete offline reconstruction chain. A fairly simple analysis using a set of sequential cuts is described, as well as a more sophisticated multivariate method using a boosted decision tree. This study is directed toward a start-up scenario in which the LHC luminosity is 10^32^-2 s^-1, integrating to 100 pb^-1 of data sample.
Observation and study of the Higgs boson candidate in the two photon decay channel with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the two photon decay channel with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The proton-proton collision datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.8 fbâ1 collected at âs = 7 TeV and 13.0 fbâ1 collected at âs = 8 TeV. These results confirm the observation of a new boson which was previously reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations with the combination of several decay channels, and, for the first time, establish the observation in the diphoton channel alone. With the additional data, the observation has a local significance of 6.1 standard deviations with a measured mass of 126.6 Â± 0.3 (stat) Â± 0.7 (syst) GeV. The fitted number of signal events is found to be 1.80 Â± 0.30 (stat) +0.21 â0.15 (syst) +0.20 â0.14 (theory) times the value predicted by the Standard Model. The spin of the new particle is studied by comparing the data to the SM Higgs boson expectations and to specific spin-2 models.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in final states with charged leptons, neutrinos, and b quarks. A search for heavy resonances decaying to a Higgs boson and a vector boson is presented. The analysis is performed using data samples collected in 2015 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.2-2.5 fb^-1. The search is performed in channels in which the vector boson decays into leptonic final states (Z→νν, W →ℓν, and Z→ℓℓ, with ℓ = e, μ), while the Higgs boson decays to collimated b quark pairs detected as a single massive jet. The discriminating power of a jet mass requirement and a b jet tagging algorithm are exploited to suppress the standard model backgrounds. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the background expectation. In the context of a theoretical model with a heavy vector triplet, a resonance with mass less than 2 TeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. The results are also interpreted in terms of limits on the parameters of the model, improving on the reach of previous searches.
Combined measurements of Higgs boson production and decay using up to 80 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS experiment. Combined measurements of Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions are presented. The combination is based on the analyses of the Higgs boson decay modes H →γγ, ZZ^∗, WW^∗, ττ, bb̅, μμ, searches for decays into invisible final states, and on measurements of off-shell Higgs boson production. Up to 79.8 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data collected at √(s)= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector are used. Results are presented for the gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes, and for associated production with vector bosons or top quarks. The combined measurement yields an observed (expected) significance for the vector-boson fusion production process of 6.5σ (5.3σ). This single-experiment observation follows an earlier observation in the combination of ATLAS and CMS measurements. Measurements in kinematic regions defined within the simplified template cross section framework are also shown. The results are interpreted in terms of modifiers applied to the Standard Model couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles, and are used to set exclusion limits on parameters in two Higgs doublet models and in the simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed.
Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson and search for an additional resonance in the four-lepton final state at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. Studies of Higgs boson properties are presented using the H→ Z Z→4ℓ (ℓ= e,μ) decay channel. These studies are performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016. The observed significance for the standard model Higgs boson with m_ H=125.09 GeV is 6.2σ, where the expected significance is 6.5σ. The signal strength modifier μ, defined as the production cross section of the Higgs boson times its branching fraction to four leptons relative to the standard model expectation, is measured to be μ=0.99^+0.33_-0.26 at m_ H=125.09 GeV. The signal-strength modifiers for the main Higgs boson production modes have also been constrained. The model independent fiducial cross section is measured to be 2.29^+0.74_-0.64( stat.)^+0.30_-0.23( sys.)^+0.01_-0.05( model dep.) fb and differential cross sections as a function of the p_ T of the Higgs boson and the number of associated jets are determined. The mass is measured to be m_ H=124.50^+0.48_-0.46 GeV and the width is constrained to be Γ_ H<41 MeV. The anomalous effects in the Higgs interactions with a pair of Z bosons are constrained under the assumption of a spin-zero resonance. Finally, a search for an additional resonance decaying to ZZ is performed for a range of masses up to 2.5 TeV and with various widths and no significant excess is observed.
Constraints on the Higgs boson self-coupling from the combination of single-Higgs and double-Higgs production analyses performed with the ATLAS experiment. Constraints on the Higgs boson self-coupling are set by combining the single Higgs boson analyses targeting the γγ, ZZ^*, WW^*, τ^+ τ^- and bb̅ decay channels and the double Higgs boson analyses in the bb̅bb̅, bb̅τ^+τ^- and bb̅γγ decay channels, using data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data used in these analyses correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 79.8 fb^-1 for single Higgs boson analyses and up to 36.1 fb^-1 for the double Higgs boson analyses. With the assumption that new physics affects only the Higgs boson self-coupling (λ_HHH), values outside the interval -2.3<λ_HHH/λ_HHH^SM< 10.3 are excluded at 95% confidence level. Results with less stringent assumptions are also provided, introducing additional coupling modifiers for the Higgs boson interactions with the other Standard Model particles.
A Search for Light CP-Odd Higgs Bosons Decaying to mu+ mu- in ATLAS. We present a search for a very light -odd Higgs boson, , decaying to , using 36.7 of collisions at = 7 recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Such a light Higgs is predicted in Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Models (NMSSM) designed to solve the μ-term problem of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Its presence can significantly alter the phenomenology of the MSSM Higgs sector. We set new limits on the production cross section times branching ratio, , for masses of 6 – 9 and 11 – 12 , avoiding the region dominated by the resonances.
Study of the spin and parity of the Higgs boson in HVV decays with the ATLAS detector. In this paper, studies of the spin, parity and Lagrangian tensor structure of the Higgs boson in the , and decay processes at the LHC are presented. The investigations are based on 25fbâ1 of pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at sâ=7 and sâ=8 . The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson hypothesis, corresponding to the quantum numbers JP=0+, is tested against several alternative spin models. They include the non-SM spin-0 and the spin-2 model with universal and non-universal couplings to fermions and vector bosons. The analysed data allow to exclude all alternative models in favour of the SM Higgs boson hypothesis at more than 99.9% confidence level. The tensor structure of the HVV interaction in the spin-0 hypothesis is also investigated using the and decays. The observed distributions of the variables sensitive to the ratios of the non-SM tensor couplings to the SM ones, and , are compatible with the SM predicted values of zero. Assuming that the and couplings are the same for the HWW and HZZ processes, values of the BSM couplings outside the intervals â0.73<<0.63 and â2.18<<0.83 are excluded at 95
Measurements of the Higgs boson width and anomalous HVV couplings from on-shell and off-shell production in the four-lepton final state. Studies of on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson production in the four-lepton final state are presented, using data from the CMS experiment at the LHC that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 80.2ââfb-1 at a center-of-mass energy of 13Â TeV. Joint constraints are set on the Higgs boson total width and parameters that express its anomalous couplings to two electroweak vector bosons. These results are combined with those obtained from the data collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8Â TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7ââfb-1, respectively. Kinematic information from the decay particles and the associated jets are combined using matrix element techniques to identify the production mechanism and to increase sensitivity to the Higgs boson couplings in both production and decay. The constraints on anomalous HVV couplings are found to be consistent with the standard model expectation in both the on-shell and off-shell regions. Under the assumption of a coupling structure similar to that in the standard model, the Higgs boson width is constrained to be 3.2-2.2+2.8ââMeV while the expected constraint based on simulation is 4.1-4.0+5.0ââMeV. The constraints on the width remain similar with the inclusion of the tested anomalous HVV interactions.
Combined Standard Model Higgs boson searches with up to 2.3 inverse femtobarns of pp collision data at sqrt(s)=7 TeV at the LHC. A combination of searches for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC is presented. The dataset used corresonds to an integrated luminosity per experiment ranging from 1.0 to 2.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The combination includes searches using the following Higgs boson decay signatures: H→γγ, H→bb, H→ττ, H→WW(ℓνℓν) and H→ZZ(4ℓ, 2ℓ 2ν, 2ℓ 2q, 2ℓ 2τ). The SM Higgs boson masses tested in these searches range from 110 to 600 GeV/c^2. The expected exclusion region in the absence of a signal is 124–520 GeV/c^2. The observed data are compatible with the background-only hypothesis and the SM Higgs boson is excluded at 95
Search for top quark decays via Higgs-boson-mediated flavor-changing neutral currents in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV. A search is performed for Higgs-boson-mediated flavor-changing neutral currents in the decays of top quarks. The search is based on proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events in which a top quark pair is produced with one top quark decaying into a charm or up quark and a Higgs boson (H), and the other top quark decaying into a bottom quark and a W boson are selected. The Higgs boson in these events is assumed to subsequently decay into either dibosons or difermions. No significant excess is observed above the expected standard model background, and an upper limit at the 95

A search for a Higgs boson decaying into invisible particles is performed using the datacollected at LEP by the L3 experiment at centre-of-mass energies of183 and 189. The integrated luminosities are respectively 55.3 and 176.4 .The observed candidates are consistent with the expectations from StandardModel processes.In the hypothesis that the production cross section of this Higgs bosonequals the Standard Model one and the branching ratio into invisibleparticles is 100
Search for Higgs boson pair production in the γγ bb̅ final state with 13 TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment. A search is performed for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bb final state. The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^â1 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess relative to the Standard Model expectation is observed. The observed limit on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair cross-section is 0.73 pb at 95% confidence level. This observed limit is equivalent to 22 times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. The Higgs boson self-coupling (Îº_Î»â=âÎ»_HHH/Î»_HHH^SM ) is constrained at 95% confidence level to â8.2 < Îº_Î» < 13.2. For resonant Higgs boson pair production through X→ HH→ bb , the limit is presented, using the narrow-width approximation, as a function of m_X in the range 260 GeV < m_X < 1000 GeV. The observed limits range from 1.1 pb to 0.12 pb over this mass range.
Search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalars in the final state with two b quarks and two τ leptons in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar bosons is performed for the first time in the final state with two b quarks and two Ï leptons. The search is motivated in the context of models of physics beyond the standard model (SM), such as two Higgs doublet models extended with a complex scalar singlet (2HDMâ¯+â¯S), which include the next-to-minimal supersymmetric SM (NMSSM). The results are based on a data set of protonâproton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fbâ1 , accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV . Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15 and 60GeV are probed, and no excess of events above the SM expectation is observed. Upper limits between 3 and 12% are set on the branching fraction B(hâaaâ2Ï2b) assuming the SM production of the Higgs boson. Upper limits are also set on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to two light pseudoscalar bosons in different 2HDMâ¯+â¯S scenarios. Assuming the SM production cross section for the Higgs boson, the upper limit on this quantity is as low as 20% for a mass of the pseudoscalar of 40GeV in the NMSSM.
Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson decaying to a W boson pair in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. Measurements of the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W boson pair are reported. The W^+ W^- candidates are selected in events with an oppositely charged lepton pair and large missing transverse momentum, and with different numbers of jets. To select Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion and associated production with a W or Z boson, events with two jets and three or four leptons are also selected. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, collected in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC during 2016. Combining all the channels, the observed cross section times branching ratio is 1.28 ^+0.18_-0.17 times the standard model prediction for the Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09 GeV.
Measurement of differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel in pp collisions at √(s)= 8 TeV. A measurement is presented of differential cross sections for the Higgs boson (H) production in pp collisions at √(s)= 8 TeV. The analysis exploits the H→γγ decay in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The cross section is measured as a function of the kinematic properties of the diphoton system and of the associated jets. Results corrected for detector effects are compared with predictions at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, as well as with predictions beyond the standard model.For isolated photons with pseudorapidities | η | lower than 2.5, and with the photon of largest and next-to-largest transverse momentum (p_T^γ) divided by the diphoton mass m_γγ satisfying the respective conditions of p_T^γ/m_γγ larger than 1/3 and 1/4, the total fiducial cross section is 32 ± 10 fb.
Search for displaced muonic lepton jets from light Higgs boson decay in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is performed for collimated muon pairs produced in the decay of long-lived neutral particles in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV center of mass energy, with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. In a sample of 1.94 fb-1 of collision events collected during 2011, the observed data are consistent with the Standard Model background expectations. Limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction of a Higgs boson decaying to Hidden Valley neutral long-lived particles are derived as a function of the particlesâ mean life time.
Search for high mass Higgs to WW with fully leptonic decays using 2015 data. A search for a heavy Higgs boson in the H→WW→ℓνℓ'ν' decay channel is reported. The search is based upon proton-proton collision data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 2.3 fb^-1 at √(s) = 13 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2015. The limits are interpreted as constraints on the production of a heavy scalar in the electroweak singlet model.
Search for the Higgs boson in the H → WW → lν jj decay channel at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson has been performed in the H → WW → lν jj channel using 4.7 fb^-1 of pp collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Higgs boson candidates produced in association with zero, one or two jets are included in the analysis to maximize the acceptance for both gluon fusion and weak boson fusion Higgs boson production processes. No significant excess of events is observed over the expected background and limits on the Higgs boson production cross section are derived for a Higgs boson mass in the range 300 GeV < m_H < 600 GeV. The best sensitivity is reached for m_H = 400 GeV, where the observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper bound on the cross section for H → WW produced in association with zero or one jet is 2.2 pb (1.9 pb), corresponding to 1.9 (1.6) times the Standard Model prediction. In the Higgs boson plus two jets channel, which is more sensitive to the weak boson fusion process, the observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper bound on the cross section for H → WW production with m_H = 400 GeV is 0.7 pb (0.6 pb), corresponding to 7.9 (6.5) times the Standard Model prediction.
Limits on Higgs boson masses from combining the data of the four LEP experiments at √(s)≤ 183 GeV.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying via H^±→τ^±ν in fully hadronic final states using pp collision data at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The results of a search for charged Higgs bosons decaying to a τ lepton and a neutrino, H^±→τ^±ν, are presented. The analysis is based on 19.5 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at √(s)=8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Charged Higgs bosons are searched for in events consistent with top-quark pair production or in associated production with a top quark. The final state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic τ decay, missing transverse momentum, b-tagged jets, a hadronically decaying W boson, and the absence of any isolated electrons or muons with high transverse momenta. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. A statistical analysis leads to 95% confidence-level upper limits on the product of branching ratios B(t→ bH^±) × B(H^±→τ^±ν), between 0.23% and 1.3% for charged Higgs boson masses in the range 80–160 GeV. It also leads to 95% confidence-level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio, σ(pp → tH^± + X) × B(H^±→τ^±ν), between 0.76 pb and 4.5 fb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 180 GeV to 1000 GeV. In the context of different scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, these results exclude nearly all values of tanβ above one for charged Higgs boson masses between 80 GeV and 160 GeV, and exclude a region of parameter space with high tanβ for H^± masses between 200 GeV and 250 GeV.
Search for Higgs boson production in association with a high-energy photon via vector boson fusion with decay to bottom quark pairs at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for the production of the Standard Model Higgs boson in association with a high-energy photon. With a focus on the vector boson fusion process and the dominant Higgs decay to b quark pairs, the search benefits from a large reduction of multijet background compared to more inclusive searches. Results are reported from the analysis of 132 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s)=13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measured Higgs boson signal yield in this final state signature is 1.3±1.0 times the Standard Model prediction. The observed significance of the Higgs boson signal above the background is 1.3 standard deviations compared to an expected significance of 1.0 standard deviations.
Search for the tH(H→bb̅) process in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV and study of Higgs boson couplings. A search for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark (tH) is presented. The analysis focuses on Higgs boson decays to bottom quark-antiquark pairs and leptonic top quark decays. The full data set of pp collisions recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, is analyzed. A multivariate classifier is used to discriminate signal candidates from the overwhelming background processes. Several scenarios for varied strength of the coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks and to vector bosons are examined and limits on the combined cross section for Higgs boson production, either in association with a pair of top quarks or a single top quark, are derived. In addition, limits on the signal strength of Higgs boson production in association with a single top quark are set for two specific cases. The observed (expected) limit for tH production in the standard model is 89.5 (41.4) times the predicted cross section. In case of an inverted top-Higgs coupling, the observed (expected) limit is 5.83 (2.94) times the prediction.
Search for neutral Higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the neutral Higgs bosons predicted by the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is reported. The analysis is performed on data from proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The samples used for this search were collected in 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities in the range 19.5 - 20.3 fb^-1. The MSSM Higgs bosons are searched for in the ττ final state. No significant excess over the expected background is observed, and exclusion limits are derived for the production cross section times branching fraction of a scalar particle as a function of its mass. The results are also interpreted in the MSSM parameter space for various benchmark scenarios.
Measurement of the Higgs boson production rate in association with top quarks in final states with electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying tau leptons at √(s) = 13 TeV. The rate for Higgs (H) bosons production in association with either one (tH) or two (tt̅H) top quarks is measured in final states containing multiple electrons, muons, or tau leptons decaying to hadrons and a neutrino, using proton-proton collisions recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS experiment. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. The analysis is aimed at events that contain H→WW, H→ττ, or H→ZZ decays and each of the top quark(s) decays either to lepton+jets or all-jet channels. Sensitivity to signal is maximized by including ten signatures in the analysis, depending on the lepton multiplicity. The separation among the tH, the tt̅H, and the backgrounds is enhanced through machine-learning techniques and matrix-element methods. The measured production rates for the tt̅H and tH signals correspond to 0.92 ± 0.19 (stat) ^+0.17_-0.13 (syst) and 5.7 ± 2.7 (stat) ± 3.0 (syst) of their respective standard model (SM) expectations. The corresponding observed (expected) significance amounts to 4.7 (5.2) standard deviations for tt̅H, and to 1.4 (0.3) for tH production. Assuming that the Higgs boson coupling to the tau lepton is equal in strength to its expectation in the SM, the coupling y_t of the Higgs boson to the top quark divided by its SM expectation, κ_t=y_t/y_t^SM, is constrained to be within -0.9 < κ_t < -0.7 or 0.7 < κ_t < 1.1, at 95% confidence level. This result is the most sensitive measurement of the tt̅H production rate to date.
Search for Higgs boson pair production in events with two bottom quarks and two tau leptons in protonâproton collisions at √(s) =13TeV. A search for the production of Higgs boson pairs in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Events with one Higgs boson decaying into two bottom quarks and the other decaying into two τ leptons are explored to investigate both resonant and nonresonant production mechanisms. The data are found to be consistent, within uncertainties, with the standard model background predictions. For resonant production, upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section for Higgs boson pairs as a function of the hypothesized resonance mass and are interpreted in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. For nonresonant production, upper limits on the production cross section constrain the parameter space for anomalous Higgs boson couplings. The observed (expected) upper limit at 95% confidence level corresponds to about 30 (25) times the prediction of the standard model.
Search for a Multi-Higgs Boson Cascade in W^+W^â bb̅ events with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at âs = 8 TeV. A search is presented for new particles in an extension to the Standard Model that includes a heavy Higgs boson (H^0), an intermediate charged Higgs boson (HÂ±), and a light Higgs boson (h^0). The analysis searches for events involving the production of a single heavy neutral Higgs boson which decays to the charged Higgs boson and a W boson, where the charged Higgs boson subsequently decays into a W boson and the lightest neutral Higgs boson decaying to a bottom-antibottom-quark pair. Such a cascade results in a W-boson pair and a bottomâantibottom-quark pair in the final state. Events with exactly one lepton, missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets are selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1, collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at âs = 8 TeV at the LHC. The data are found to be consistent with Standard Model predictions, and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the product of cross-section and branching ratio. These limits range from 0.065 pb to 43 pb as a function of H^0 and HÂ± masses, with m_h0 fixed at 125 GeV.
Evidence for a particle decaying to W+W- in the fully leptonic final state in a standard model Higgs boson search in pp collisions at the LHC. An update of a previous search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to W^+W^- in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV and √(s) = 8 TeV is reported. The event sample corresponds to the full integrated luminosity collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to 4.9 fb^-1 and 19.5 fb^-1, respectively. The W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with two oppositely charged leptons and large missing transverse momentum. An excess of events is observed above background which is consistent with the expectations from a standard model Higgs boson of mass around 125 GeV and has a statistical significance of 4.0 standard deviations for this mass. This result provides evidence for a Higgs-like particle decaying to W^+W^-. Additional standard model Higgs-like bosons are excluded in the mass range 128-600 GeV at 95 The hypothesis of the standard model Higgs boson for quantum numbers and couplings is tested against the hypothesis of a narrow spin-2 resonance produced through the gluon fusion mechanism and with minimal couplings to the W^+W^- pair.
Search for a charged Higgs boson decaying into top and bottom quarks in proton-proton collisions at 13TeV in events with electrons or muons. A search is presented for a charged Higgs boson heavier than the top quark and decaying into a top-bottom quark-antiquark pair. Events are selected by the presence of a single isolated charged lepton (electron or muon) or an opposite sign dilepton (electron or muon) pair, categorized according to the jet multiplicity and the number of jets containing a b-hadron decay, and multivariate techniques are used to enhance the signal-background discrimination in each category. This search is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The data are compatible with the standard model, and 95
Search for Anomalous Couplings in the Higgs Sector at LEP. Anomalous couplings of the Higgs boson are searched for through the processes e^+ e^- -> H gamma, e^+ e^- -> e^+ e^- H and e^+ e^- -> HZ. The mass range 70 GeV < m_H < 190 GeV is explored using 602 pb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies sqrt(s)=189-209 GeV. The Higgs decay channels H -> ffbar, H -> gamma gamma, H -> Zγand H -> WW^(*) are considered and no evidence is found for anomalous Higgs production or decay. Limits on the anomalous couplings d, db, Delta(g1z), Delta(kappa_gamma) and xi^2 are derived as well as limits on the H -> gamma gamma and H -> Z gamma decay rates.
Search for Higgs boson decays to beyond-the-Standard-Model light bosons in four-lepton events with the ATLAS detector at √(s)=13 TeV. A search is conducted for a new beyond-the-Standard-Model boson using events where a Higgs boson with mass 125 GeV decays to four leptons (ℓ = e or μ). This decay is presumed to occur via an intermediate state which contains one or two on-shell, promptly decaying bosons: H→ ZX/XX → 4ℓ, where X is a new vector boson Z_d or pseudoscalar a with mass between 1 and 60 GeV. The search uses pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV. No significant excess of events above Standard Model background predictions is observed; therefore, upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on model-independent fiducial cross-sections, and on the Higgs boson decay branching ratios to vector and pseudoscalar bosons in two benchmark models.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson in the dilepton plus photon channel in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of electrons or muons plus a photon is described. This final state has contributions from Higgs decays to a Z boson and a photon (H→Zγ→ℓℓγ , ℓ=e or μ), or to two photons, one of which has an internal conversion into a lepton pair (H→γ^*γ→μμγ). The analysis is performed using a dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. No significant excess above the background prediction has been found in the 120-130 GeV mass range. Limits are set on the cross section for a standard model Higgs boson decaying to opposite-sign electron or muon pairs and a photon. The observed limits on cross section times the corresponding branching fractions fluctuate between 4 and 1.4 (11 and 6) times the standard model cross section for H→γ^*γ→μμγ (H→Zγ→ℓℓγ). The H→γ^*γ→μμγ and H→Zγ→ℓℓγ analyses are combined for m_H=125 GeV, obtaining an observed (expected) 95
Search for Dark Matter in association with a Higgs boson decaying to b-quarks in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for dark matter pair production in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks is presented, using 3.2 of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The decay of the Higgs boson is reconstructed as a high-momentum bb̅ system with either a pair of small-radius jets, or a single large-radius jet with substructure. The observed data are found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Results are interpreted using a simplified model with a Z' gauge boson mediating the interaction between dark matter and the Standard Model as well as a two-Higgs-doublet model containing an additional Z' boson which decays to a Standard Model Higgs boson and a new pseudoscalar Higgs boson, the latter decaying into a pair of dark matter particles.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into two Higgs bosons or into a Higgs boson and a W or Z boson in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. A search is presented for massive narrow resonances decaying either into two Higgs bosons, or into a Higgs boson and a W or Z boson. The decay channels considered are HH→bbτ^+τ^- and VH→qqτ^+τ^-, where H denotes the Higgs boson, and V denotes the W or Z boson. This analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV by the CMS Collaboration, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. For the TeV-scale mass resonances considered, substructure techniques provide ways to differentiate among the hadronization products from vector boson decays to quarks, Higgs boson decays to bottom quarks, and quark- or gluon-induced jets. Reconstruction techniques are used that have been specifically optimized to select events in which the tau lepton pair is highly boosted. The observed data are consistent with standard model expectations and upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the product of cross section and branching fraction for resonance masses between 0.9 and 4.0 TeV. Exclusion limits are set in the context of bulk radion and graviton models: spin-0 radion resonances are excluded below a mass of 2.7 TeV at 95% confidence level. In the spin-1 heavy vector triplet framework, mass-degenerate W' and Z' resonances with dominant couplings to the standard model gauge bosons are excluded below a mass of 2.8 TeV at 95% confidence level. There are the first limits for these decay channels at √(s)= 13 TeV.
Search for a light charged Higgs boson decaying to a W boson and a CP-odd Higgs boson in eμμ/μμμ + jets channels in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for a light charged Higgs boson (H^+) decaying to a W boson and a CP-odd Higgs boson (A) is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. The data were recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. In this search, it is assumed that the H^+ boson is produced in decays of top quarks, and the A boson decays to two opposite-charge muons. The presence of signals for H^+ boson masses between 100 and 160 GeV and A boson masses between 15 and 75 GeV is investigated. No evidence for the production of the H^+ boson is found. Assuming branching ratios ℬ(H^+→W^+A)=1 and ℬ(A→μ^+μ^-)=3×10^-4, upper limits at 95
Updated search for a light charged Higgs boson in top quark decays in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. Updated results are presented in the search for a light charged Higgs boson that can be produced in the top quark decay t → H^+b with subsequent decay of H^+ into τ^+ν_τ. The search is sensitive to the decays of the top quark pairs tt̅→ H^± W^∓ b b̅ and t t̅→ H^± H^∓ b b̅. The results in the μτ + E_ T^ miss+jet signature are updated with an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb^-1 recorded in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC, and are combined with results of a previous search in other decay channels, based on an integrated luminosity of about 2 fb^-1 . Upper limits on the branching fraction ℬ(t → H^+ b) in the range of 2–3 are established for charged Higgs boson masses between 80 and 160 GeV, under the assumption that ℬ(H^+→τ^+ν_τ) = 1.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying via H^±→τ^±ν in hadronic final states using pp collision data at √(s) = 8 with the ATLAS detector. The results of a search for charged Higgs bosons decaying to a tau lepton and a neutrino, H^±→τ^±ν, are presented. The analysis is based on 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)=8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Charged Higgs bosons are searched for in events consistent with top-quark pair production or in associated production with a top quark. The final state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic τ decay, missing transverse momentum, b-jets, a hadronically decaying W boson, and the absence of any electrons or muons. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. This leads to 95 % confidence level upper limits on the branching ratio of top-quark decays to a b quark and a charged Higgs boson times branching ratio, B(t→ bH^±) × B(H^±→τ^±ν), between 0.23 % and 1.3 % for charged Higgs boson masses in the range 80-160 GeV. This also leads to 95 % confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio, σ(pp → tH^± + X) × B(H^±→τ^±ν), between 0.0045 pb and 0.76 pb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 180 GeV to 1000 GeV.
Search for a heavy Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W bosons in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for a heavy Higgs boson in the mass range from 0.2 to 3.0 TeV, decaying to a pair of W bosons, is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The W boson pair decays are reconstructed in the 2ℓ 2ν and ℓν 2q final states (with ℓ = e or μ). Both gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production of the signal are considered. Interference effects between the signal and background are also taken into account. The observed data are consistent with the standard model (SM) expectation. Combined upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the cross section and branching fraction exclude a heavy Higgs boson with SM-like couplings and decays up to 1870 GeV. Exclusion limits are also set in the context of a number of two-Higgs-doublet model formulations, further reducing the allowed parameter space for SM extensions.
Combined measurements of the Higgs boson's couplings at √(s)=13 TeV. Combined measurements of the Higgs boson's production and decay rates, as well its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision data set recorded by the CMS detector in 2016 at √(s)=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The combination is based on the analysis of the production processes gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the H→ZZ, WW, γγ, ττ, bb, and μμ decay modes. Dedicated searches for invisible Higgs boson decays are also considered. The combined signal strength is measured as μ=1.17^+0.10_-0.10. The Higgs boson production and decay rates are combined within the context of two generic parameterizations: one based on the ratios of cross sections and branching ratios, and the other based on the ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the results, with more model-dependent parameterizations derived from the generic ones, are also given. The results are compatible with the standard model predictions in all of the parameterizations considered. The results are used to place constraints on the parameter spaces of various two Higgs doublet models.
A measurement of the Higgs boson mass in the diphoton decay channel. A measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel is presented. This analysis is based on 35.9 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The Higgs boson mass is measured to be m_H = 125.78 ± 0.26 GeV. This is combined with a measurement of m_H already performed in the H → ZZ^* → 4l decay channel using the same dataset, giving m_H = 125.46 ± 0.17 GeV. This result, when combined with an earlier measurement of the Higgs boson mass using data collected in 2011 and 2012 with the CMS detector, gives a value for the Higgs boson mass of m_H = 125.35 ± 0.15 GeV. In this note we summarize the strategy of this measurement in the H →γγ final state emphasizing the methods employed to mitigate and to quantify the main sources of systematic uncertainty. The combination strategy is also described.
Observation and measurement of Higgs boson decays to WW^∗ with the ATLAS detector. We report the observation of Higgs boson decays to WW^∗ based on an excess over background of 6.1 standard deviations in the dilepton final state, where the Standard Model expectation is 5.8 standard deviations. Evidence for the vector-boson fusion (VBF) production process is obtained with a significance of 3.2 standard deviations. The results are obtained from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25 pb^-1 from √(s)=7 and 8 TeV pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. For a Higgs boson mass of 125.36 GeV, the ratio of the measured value to the expected value of the total production cross section times branching fraction is 1.09^+0.16_-0.15 (stat.)^+0.17_-0.14 (syst.). The corresponding ratios for the gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion production mechanisms are 1.02± 0.19 (stat.)^+0.22_-0.18 (syst.) and 1.27^+0.44_-0.40 (stat.)^+0.30_-0.21 (syst.), respectively. At √(s)=8 TeV, the total production cross sections are measured to be σ(gg→ H→ WW^∗) = 4.6±0.9 (stat.) ^+0.8_-0.7 (syst.)pb and σ(VBF H→ WW^∗) = 0.51 ^+0.17_-0.15 (stat.) ^+0.13_-0.08 (syst.)pb. The fiducial cross section is determined for the gluon-fusion process in exclusive final states with zero or one associated jet.
Measurement of the transverse momentum spectrum of the Higgs boson produced in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV using the H→WW decays. Differential and integrated fiducial cross sections for the Higgs boson production are measured using the H→W^+ W^- leptonic decays with an oppositely charged electron-muon pair and a pair of neutrinos in the final state. The measurements are performed using pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Collision data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 fb^-1. The Higgs boson transverse momentum is reconstructed using the lepton pair transverse momentum and missing transverse momentum, which originates from the presence of two neutrinos in the final state. The differential cross section is measured as a function of the Higgs boson transverse momentum in a fiducial phase space defined to match the experimental acceptance in terms of the lepton kinematics and event topology. The inclusive production cross section times branching fraction in the fiducial phase space is measured to be 39 ± 8(stat)± 9(syst)fb. The measurements are compared to theoretical calculations based on the standard model, and found to be in agreement with them within the experimental uncertainties.
Search for a light charged Higgs boson in the H^±→cs channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is conducted for a low-mass charged Higgs boson produced in a top quark decay and subsequently decaying into a charm and a strange quark. The data sample was recorded in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search is performed in the process of top quark pair production, where one top quark decays to a bottom quark and a charged Higgs boson, and the other to a bottom quark and a W boson. With the W boson decaying to a charged lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino, the final state comprises an isolated lepton, missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets, of which two are tagged as b jets. To enhance the search sensitivity, one of the jets originating from the charged Higgs boson is required to satisfy a charm tagging selection. No significant excess beyond standard model predictions is found in the dijet invariant mass distribution. An upper limit in the range 1.68-0.25% is set on the branching fraction of the top quark decay to the charged Higgs boson and bottom quark for a charged Higgs boson mass between 80 and 160 GeV.
Search for heavy Higgs bosons decaying to a top quark pair in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is presented for additional scalar (H) or pseudoscalar (A) Higgs bosons decaying to a top quark pair in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data set analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Final states with one or two charged leptons are considered. The invariant mass of the reconstructed top quark pair system and variables that are sensitive to the spin of the particles decaying into the top quark pair are used to search for signatures of the H or A bosons. The interference with the standard model top quark pair background is taken into account. A moderate signal-like deviation compatible with an A boson with a mass of 400 GeV is observed with a global significance of 1.9 standard deviations. New stringent constraints are reported on the strength of the coupling of the hypothetical bosons to the top quark, with the mass of the bosons ranging from 400 to 750 GeV and their total relative width from 0.5 to 25%. The results of the search are also interpreted in a minimal supersymmetric standard model scenario. Values of m_A from 400 to 700 GeV are probed, and a region with values of tanβ below 1.0 to 1.5, depending on m_A, is excluded at 95% confidence level.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson at LEP. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have collected a total of 2461 pb-1 of e+e- collision data at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV. The data are used to search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The search results of the four collaborations are combined and examined in a likelihood test for their consistency with two hypotheses: the background hypothesis and the signal plus background hypothesis. The corresponding confidences have been computed as functions of the hypothetical Higgs boson mass. A lower bound of 114.4 GeV/c2 is established, at the 95% confidence level, on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson. The LEP data are also used to set upper bounds on the HZZ coupling for various assumptions concerning the decay of the Higgs boson.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying into two muons in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=13TeV. A search for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson decaying to two muons is presented using data recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Limits are set on the cross section of the Higgs boson decaying to two muons for mass hypotheses between 120 and 130 GeV. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV decaying to two muons, the 95
Search for Non-Resonant Higgs Pair-Production in the bbbb Final State with the CMS detector. Results of a search for non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs decaying to two b b̅ pairs are presented. This search uses data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. No signal is observed, and an upper limit of 847 fb is set on the standard model cross section for non-resonant Higgs boson pair-production, where the Higgs bosons decay to b b̅ pairs. The same signature is studied in the context of theories of physics beyond the standard model that predict modified couplings of the Higgs boson, and used to extract limits on Higgs boson anomalous couplings.
Search for a low-mass pseudoscalar Higgs boson produced in association with a b b̅ pair in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search is reported for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons, produced in association with a b b̅ pair, in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models. The results are based on pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. Pseudoscalar boson masses between 25 and 80 GeV are probed. No evidence for a pseudoscalar boson is found and upper limits are set on the production cross section times branching fraction to τ pairs between 7 and 39 pb at the 95% confidence level. This search excludes a pseudoscalar Higgs boson with mass below 80 GeV, in Type II two-Higgs-doublet models with a negative coupling of standard model-like Higgs boson to down-type fermions.
Search for a heavy pseudoscalar Higgs boson decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson and a Z boson in final states with two tau and two light leptons at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is performed for a pseudoscalar Higgs boson, A, decaying into a 125 GeV Higgs boson h and a Z boson. The h boson is specifically targeted in its decay into a pair of tau leptons, while the Z boson decays into a pair of electrons or muons. A data sample of proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at √(s) = 13 TeV is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. No excess above the standard model background expectations is observed in data. A model-independent upper limit is set on the product of the gluon fusion production cross section for the A boson and the branching fraction to Zh→ℓℓττ. The observed upper limit at 95% confidence level ranges from 27 to 5 fb for A boson masses from 220 to 400 GeV, respectively. The results are used to constrain the extended Higgs sector parameters for two benchmark scenarios of the minimal supersymmetric standard model.
Search for doubly- and singly-charged Higgs bosons decaying into vector bosons in multi-leptons final states with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into W^± W^± or W^± Z bosons is performed, involving experimental signatures with two leptons of the same-charge, or three or four leptons with a variety of charge combinations, missing transverse momentum and jets. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018 is used. The data correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. The search is guided by a type II seesaw model that extends the scalar sector of the Standard Model with a scalar triplet, leading to a phenomenology that includes doubly- and singly-charged Higgs bosons. Two scenarios are explored, corresponding to the pair production of doubly-charged H^±± bosons, or the associated production of doubly-charged H^±± bosons with singly-charged H^± bosons. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed. H^±± bosons are excluded at 95
Search for Neutral Higgs Bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in e^+e^- Interactions at √(s) up to 209 GeV. A search for the lightest neutral CP-even and neutral CP-odd Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is performed using 216.6 pb-1 of data collected with the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies between 203 and 209 GeV. No indication of a signal is found. Including our results from lower centre-of-mass energies, lower limits on the Higgs boson masses are set as a function of tan(beta) for several scenarios. For tan(beta) greater than 0.7 they are mh > 84.5 GeV and mA > 86.3 GeV at 95% confidence level.
Study of the spin properties of the Higgs-like particle in the H→ WW^(∗)→ eνμν channel with 21 fb^-1 of √(s) = 8 TeV data collected with the ATLAS detector.. Recently, the ATLAS collaboration reported the observation of a new neutral particle in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson. The measured production rate of the new particle is consistent with the Standard Model Higgs boson if it has a mass of about 125 GeV. This note reports on the compatibility of the observed excess in the H→ WW^(*)→ e νμν search with either a spin-0 or a spin-2 particle with positive charge-parity. Analysis of the LHC collision data collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector results in the exclusion of a benchmark spin-2 model at 95% confidence level, in favour of the Standard Model Higgs boson.

Search for a massive resonance decaying into a Higgs boson and a W or Z boson in hadronic final states in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for a massive resonance decaying into a standard-model-like Higgs boson (H) and a W or Z boson is reported. The analysis is performed on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Signal events, in which the decay products of Higgs, W, or Z bosons at high Lorentz boost are contained within single reconstructed jets, are identified using jet substructure techniques, including the tagging of b hadrons. This is the first search for heavy resonances decaying into HW or HZ resulting in an all-jet final state, as well as the first application of jet substructure techniques to identify H → W W^* → 4q decays at high Lorentz boost. No significant signal is observed and limits are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of W' and Z' in a model with mass-degenerate charged and neutral spin-1 resonances. Resonance masses are excluded for W' in the interval [1.0, 1.6] TeV, for Z' in the intervals [1.0, 1.1] and [1.3,1.5] TeV, and for mass-degenerate W' and Z' in the interval [1.0, 1.7] TeV.

Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H → Zγ decay mode with pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. This note presents a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H → Zγ, Z → ââ, where â=e or μ, using 20.7 fb^â1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV and 4.6 fb^â1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The distribution of the difference Δ m between the final state three-body invariant mass m_ââγ and the di-lepton invariant mass m_ââ is compared to Standard Model background expectations. No significant deviation from the SM prediction is observed and upper limits on the cross section of a Higgs boson with a mass between 120 and 150 GeV are derived. The expected exclusion limits at 95% confidence level range between 7.3 and 22 times the predicted Standard Model cross section. The observed exclusion limits range between 5.4 and 37 times the Standard Model cross section. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, the expected and observed limits are 13.5 and 18.2 times the Standard Model, respectively.
Search for lepton-flavour-violating decays of the Higgs and Z bosons with the ATLAS detector. Direct searches for lepton flavour violation in decays of the Higgs and Z bosons with the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. The following three decays are considered: H→ eτ, H→μτ, and Z→μτ. The searches are based on the data sample of proton–proton collisions collected by the ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 8 TeV. No significant excess is observed, and upper limits on the lepton-flavour-violating branching ratios are set at the 95% confidence level: Br(H→ eτ) < 1.04%, Br(H→μτ) < 1.43%, and Br(Z→μτ) < 1.69 × 10^-5.
Evidence for the Higgs-boson Yukawa coupling to tau leptons with the ATLAS detector. Results of a search for H →ττ decays are presented, based on the full set of proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during 2011 and 2012. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb^-1 and 20.3 fb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies of √(s) = 7 TeV and √(s) = 8 TeV respectively. All combinations of leptonic (τ→ℓνν̅ with ℓ = e, μ) and hadronic (τ→hadrons ν) tau decays are considered. An excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.5 (3.4) standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the direct coupling of the recently discovered Higgs boson to fermions. The measured signal strength, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, of μ = 1.43 ^+0.43_-0.37 is consistent with the predicted Yukawa coupling strength in the Standard Model.
Search for higgsino pair production in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV in final states with large missing transverse momentum and two Higgs bosons decaying via H to bb-bar. Results are reported from a search for new physics in 13Â TeV proton-proton collisions in the final state with large missing transverse momentum and two Higgs bosons decaying via HâbbÂ¯. The search uses a data sample accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9ââfb-1. The search is motivated by models based on gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, which predict the electroweak production of a pair of Higgsinos, each of which can decay via a cascade process to a Higgs boson and an undetected lightest supersymmetric particle. The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the standard model background expectation obtained from control regions in data. Higgsinos in the mass range 230â770Â GeV are excluded at 95%Â confidence level in the context of a simplified model for the production and decay of approximately degenerate Higgsinos.
A Search for Resonances Decaying to a W or Z Boson and a Higgs Boson in the qq̅^(')bb̅ Final State. A search for resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the qq̅^(')bb̅ final state is described. The search uses 13.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data are in agreement with the Standard Model background expectation, with the largest excess found at 3 TeV with a local significance of 3.5 σ. The global significance of this excess is 2.5 σ. The results are presented in terms of constraints on a simplified model with a Heavy Vector Triplet. Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio for resonances decaying to a W (Z) boson and a Higgs boson with values ranging between 0.12 and 0.006 pb (0.26 and 0.008 pb) at 95% confidence level for resonance masses in the range between 1 and 3.5 TeV.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and coupling strengths using pp collision data at âs = 7 and 8 TeV in the ATLAS experiment. Combined analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as of its coupling strengths to vector bosons and fermions are presented. Included in the combinations are the results of the decay modes H â Î³Î³, ZZâ, WWâ, ZÎ³, bb Ì, ÏÏ and Î¼Î¼, and the constraints on the associated production with a pair of top quarks and on the off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson. The results are based on the LHC proton-proton collision datasets, with integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 fbâ1 at âs = 7 TeV and 20.3 fbâ1 at âs = 8 ï¿¼ï¿¼TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and 2012. Combining all production modes and decay channels, the measured signal yield, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, is 1.18 Â± 0.10 Â± 0.07Â±0.08, where the first error reflects the statistical uncertainty and 0.07 the second and third errors reflect respectively the experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties. Strong evidence is found for the vector boson fusion process with a signific- ance of 4.3Ï. The observed Higgs boson production and decay rates are interpreted in a leading order coupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both with and without assumptions on the Higgs boson width and assumption on the SM particle content in loop processes. Within the assumption of unified couplings to up-type fermions, down-type fermions and the W/Z boson respectively, strong evidence for Higgs boson couplings to down-type fermions is found with a significance of 4.5Ï. Generic Higgs boson coupling models that allow to measure coupling strengths to Î¼, Ï leptons, b, t quarks and W , Z bosons, or ratios of these coupling strengths, are presented. The observed data are found to be compatible with the SM expectations for a Higgs boson at a mass of 125.36 GeV for all models considered.
Search for dark matter, invisible Higgs boson decays, and large extra dimensions in the ℓℓ+E_T^miss final state using 2016 data. A search for new physics in events with a Z boson produced in association with large missing transverse momentum with the CMS experiment at the LHC is presented. The search is based on the 2016 data sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The results of this search are interpreted in terms of a simplified model of dark matter production with spin-0 or spin-1 mediators, a standard model Higgs boson decaying invisibly and produced in association with the Z boson, as well as a model with large extra spatial dimensions. For all models, no significant deviation from the background expectation is found, and limits are set with respect to relevant model parameters.

A search has been conducted for the bb̅ decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion in association with a photon and two jets. The search in this bb̅γ jj signature benefits from a large reduction of QCD jet background relative to the inclusive bb̅ j j signature and from the presence of a high-tranverse-momentum photon for triggering. Results are reported from the analysis of 12.6 fb^-1 of LHC proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. The observed 95

A search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons is performed using the LHC Run 2 data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. The search for heavy resonances is performed over the mass range 0.2-2.5 TeV for the τ^+τ^- decay with at least one τ-lepton decaying into final states with hadrons. The data are in good agreement with the background prediction of the Standard Model. In the M_h^125 scenario of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, values of tanβ>8 and tanβ>21 are excluded at the 95% confidence level for m_A=1.0 TeV and m_A=1.5 TeV, respectively.

A measurement of the inclusive cross section σ_incl for the production of a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons, H→ττ, is presented. The measurement is based on pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 and 2017 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.4 fb^-1 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. A value of σ_incl ℬ(H→ττ)=2.56±0.48 (stat)±0.34 (syst) pb is obtained. Results are also presented in terms of cross sections for individual production modes and kinematic regimes.
Searches for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons with the DELPHI detector at LEP. Searches for HZ production with the Higgs boson decaying into an invisible final state were performed using the data collected by the DELPHI experiment at centre-of-mass energies between 188 GeV and 209 GeV. Both hadronic and leptonic final states of the Z boson were analysed. In addition to the search for a heavy Higgs boson, a dedicated search for a light Higgs boson down to 40 GeV/c^2 was performed. No signal was found. Assuming the Standard Model HZ production cross-section, the mass limit for invisibly decaying Higgs bosons is 112.1 GeV/c^2 at 95% confidence level. An interpretation in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) and in a Majoron model is also given.
Search for direct top squark pair production with Higgs bosons in the final state in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV. This note presents a search for direct top squark pair production followed by decays to Higgs bosons using events with one or two electrons or muons and several jets, with at least three of them identified as originating from a b quark. The analysis is performed with 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)=8 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. The results are interpreted in the context of a simplified model with pair production of a top squark t̃_2 decaying to a top squark t̃_1 via t̃_2→Ht̃_1, followed by t̃_1→t χ̃_1^0. The interpretation concentrates on the region of signal mass parameter space M(t̃_1)-M(χ̃_1^0)∼M(t), which is not covered by existing searches. The analysis excludes at the 95
Updated measurements of Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel at √(s)=13 TeV in pp collisions at CMS.. An observation of the Higgs boson production for the two photon decay channel with the 2016 LHC Run 2 data is described. The analysis is performed using the dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb^-1. The observed significance for the standard model Higgs boson at the Run 1 ATLAS+CMS combined m_H = 125.09 GeV is 5.6 σ, where 6.2 σ is expected. A maximum significance of 6.1 σ is observed at 126.0 GeV.

The fiducial cross section is measured to be σ̂_fid = 69^+18_-22 fb = 69^+16_-22 (stat.)^+8_-6 (syst.) fb, where the standard model theoretical prediction is 73.8 ± 3.8 fb.
A search for resonant Higgs-pair production in the bb̅bb̅ final state in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV. A search for TeV-scale resonances decaying via a pair of Higgs bosons to the bb̅bb̅ final state is performed with 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)=8 TeV recorded by ATLAS in 2012. The search assumes a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV. The decay of each Higgs boson is reconstructed from a pair of b-tagged jets that have small angular separation and form a dijet system with transverse momentum greater than 200 GeV. The bulk Randall-Sundrum model with a warped extra dimension and a coupling of k/M̅_Pl = 1.0 is used as a benchmark to search for resonances, corresponding to the first Kaluza-Klein excitation mode of the graviton G^*, in the range between 500 GeV and 1500 GeV. No evidence of a signal is found, and upper limits on σ(pp→G^*) × BR(G^*→HH→bb̅bb̅) are derived, giving an observed limit of 7 fb at the 95% confidence level for a KK graviton mass of 1 TeV. The benchmark model is excluded at the 95% confidence level for KK graviton masses between 590 GeV and 710 GeV.

The final states considered contain either one electron and one muon, or two electrons, or two muons, or one muon plus one hadronically decaying tau lepton, corresponding to the charged Higgs decays H^+→ tb and H^+→τ^+ν. The full production and decay chain includes gg→ H^+tb → (τ_hν) (μν b) b and gg→ H^+tb → (ℓν b b) (ℓ'ν b) b, with ℓ, ℓ' being an electron or a muon. The search is performed with 19.7 fb^-1 of data collected in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the CMS detector. We find no evidence for a charged Higgs signal and set upper limits on its production rate for mass values in the range 180-600 GeV.
Search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons in the CMS detector. This note describes the search for a Higgs boson decaying into diphotons in pp collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. Data-driven methods are used to evaluate the reconstruction and selection performance for the signal, and the background is evaluated from a fit to the data. The analysis is performed on a dataset corresponding to 1.66 fb^-1 of data recorded in 2011 by the CMS experiment. Limits are set on the cross section of a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to 2 photons, and on the cross section of a fermiophobic Higgs boson decaying to 2 photons. The expected exclusion limit at 95 the Standard Model cross section, and the observed limit fluctuates between about 1.3 and 8 times the Standard Model cross section. For the fermiophobic model, the expected exclusion limit at 95 covers the mass range between 110-116.5 GeV/c^2, while the data excludes only the mass range 110-112 GeV/c^2.

The Standard Model Higgs boson produced in vector boson fusion and decaying to a pair of τ leptons is an important channel in the search of the Higgs boson in the mass range between ≃ 115 and 145 GeV/c^2. A selection strategy for the ττ→ℓνν+τ_ hadν final state is presented as well as an expected upper limit on the signal cross section with 1 fb^-1.
Search for a heavy Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson and another heavy Higgs boson in the ℓℓ bb final state in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a heavy neutral Higgs boson, A, decaying into a Z boson and another heavy Higgs boson, H, is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 from proton–proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search considers the Z boson decaying to electrons or muons and the H boson into a pair of b-quarks. No evidence for the production of an A boson is found. Considering each production process separately, the 95% confidence-level upper limits on the pp→ A→ ZH production cross-section times the branching ratio H→ bb are in the range of 14–830 fb for the gluon–gluon fusion process and 26–570 fb for the b-associated process for the mass ranges 130–700 GeV of the H boson and process for the mass ranges 130–700 GeV of the H boson and 230–800 GeV of the A boson. The results are interpreted in the context of the two-Higgs-doublet model.
Study of the Higgs to ZZ to 2l + 2 τ final state with CMS detector.. A search for the standard model Higgs boson in the decay mode H → ZZ → 2l2τ, where l = μ, e is presented based on CMS data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV. No evidence is found for a significant deviation from standard model expectations anywhere in the ZZ mass range considered in this analysis. An upper limit at 95 standard model-like couplings, which excludes cross-sections of about ten times the expected value for Higgs boson masses in the range 200 < m_ H < 400 GeV/c^2.
Search for Associated Production of a Single Top Quark and a Higgs Boson in Leptonic Channels. A search for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark is presented, focusing on leptonic signatures provided by the H→WW and H→ττ decay modes. Due to a strong interference of the two main contributing diagrams, the production cross section of this process benefits from a substantial enhancement in the case of negative values of the top-Higgs coupling, C_t. The analysis exploits signatures with two same-sign and three leptons in the final state, and uses the full data sample collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at a center of mass energy of 8 TeV, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 ± 0.5 fb^-1. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate the signal from the dominant backgrounds. The analysis yields a 95
Precise determination of the mass of the Higgs boson and tests of compatibility of its couplings with the standard model predictions using proton collisions at 7 and 8 TeV. Properties of the Higgs boson with mass near 125 GeV are measured in proton-proton collisions with the CMS experiment at the LHC. Comprehensive sets of production and decay measurements are combined. The decay channels include γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, bb, and μμ pairs. The data samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and up to 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. From the high-resolution γγ and ZZ channels, the mass of the Higgs boson is determined to be m_H = 125.02 ^+0.26_-0.27 (stat) ^+0.14 _-0.15 (syst) GeV. For this mass value, the event yields obtained in the different analyses tagging specific decay channels and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The combined best-fit signal relative to the standard model expectation is 1.00 ± 0.09 (stat) ^+0.08_-0.07 (theo) ± 0.07 (syst) at the measured mass. The couplings of the Higgs boson are probed for deviations in magnitude from the standard model predictions in multiple ways, including searches for invisible and undetected decays. No significant deviations are found.
Evidence for the spin-0 nature of the Higgs boson using ATLAS data. Studies of the spin and parity quantum numbers of the Higgs boson are presented, based on proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The Standard Model spin-parity J^P = 0^+ hypothesis is compared with alternative hypotheses using the Higgs boson decays H →γγ, H → ZZ^* → 4 leptons and H → WW^* → lν lν, as well as the combination of these channels. The analysed dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.7 fb^-1 collected at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s) = 8 TeV. For the H → ZZ^* → 4-lepton decay mode the dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb^-1 collected at √(s) = 7 TeV is added. The data are compatible with the Standard Model J^P = 0^+ quantum numbers for the Higgs boson, whereas all alternative hypotheses studied in this letter, namely some specific J^P = 0^-, 1^+, 1^-, 2^+ models, are excluded at confidence levels above 97.8%. This exclusion holds independently of the assumptions on the coupling strengths to the Standard Model particles and in the case of the J^P = 2^+ model, of the relative fractions of gluon-fusion and quark-antiquark production of the spin-2 particle. The data thus provide evidence for the spin-0 nature of the Higgs boson, with positive parity being strongly preferred.
Search for new resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the ℓℓ bb̅, ℓν bb̅, and νν bb̅ channels in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for new resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the ℓℓ bb̅, ℓν bb̅, and νν bb̅ channels in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using a total of 3.2±0.2 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity. The search is conducted by examining the WH/ZH invariant or transverse mass distribution, looking for a localized excess. No significant excess is observed, and the results are interpreted in terms of constraints on a simplified model based on a phenomenological Lagrangian of Heavy Vector Triplets and on the production cross-section of a heavy CP-odd scalar boson.
Search for Doubly-Charged Higgs Bosons at LEP. Doubly-charged Higgs bosons are searched for in e^+e^- collision data collected with the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV. Final states with four leptons are analysed to tag the pair-production of doubly charged Higgs bosons. No significant excess is found and lower limits at 95% confidence level on the doubly-charged Higgs boson mass are derived. They vary from 95.5 GeV to 100.2 GeV, depending on the decay mode. Doubly-charged Higgs bosons which couple to electrons would modify the cross section and forward-backward asymmetry of the e^+e^- -> e^+e^- process. The measurements of these quantities do not deviate from the Standard Model expectations and doubly-charged Higgs bosons with masses up to the order of a TeV are excluded.
Inclusive search for doubly charged higgs in leptonic final states at sqrt s=7 TeV. A search for the doubly charged Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s)=7is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The double charged Higgs is a member of SU(2)_L scalar triplet Φ in extensions of the standard model which include the seesaw mechanism of type II. The search is inclusive and is performed in events with three or more isolated charged leptons of all flavours originating from the decays of pair produced triplet components Φ^++Φ^– and Φ^++Φ^-. No signal excess is observed and new world best lower limits at the 95
Search for electroweak production of a vector-like quark decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson using boosted topologies in fully hadronic final states. A search is performed for electroweak production of a vector-like top quark partner T of charge 2/3 in association with a standard model top or bottom quark, using 2.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The search targets T quarks decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson in fully hadronic final states. For a T quark with mass above 1 TeV the daughter top quark and Higgs boson are highly Lorentz-boosted and can each appear as a single hadronic jet. Jet substructure and b tagging techniques are used to identify the top quark and Higgs boson jets, and to suppress the standard model backgrounds. An excess of events is searched for in the T quark candidate mass distribution in the data, which is found to be consistent with the expected backgrounds. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the single T quark production cross sections and the branching fraction ℬ(T→ t H ), and these vary between 0.31 and 0.93 pb for T quark masses in the range 1000-1800 GeV. This is the first search for single electroweak production of a vector-like T quark in fully hadronic final states.

The Higgs decays into a charm and a strange quark or into a tau lepton and its associated neutrino are considered. The observed candidates are consistent with the expectations from Standard Model background processes. A lower limit of 57.5 on the charged Higgs mass is derived at 95
Search for supersymmetry using Higgs boson to diphoton decays at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is presented where at least one Higgs boson is produced and decays to two photons in the decay chains of pair-produced SUSY particles. Two complementary analysis strategies are pursued: one focused on strong SUSY production and the other focused on electroweak SUSY production. The presence of charged leptons, additional Higgs boson candidates, and various kinematic variables are used to categorize events into search regions that are sensitive to different SUSY scenarios. The results are based on data from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.5 fb^-1. No statistically significant excess of events is observed relative to the standard model expectations. We exclude bottom squark pair production for bottom squark masses below 530 GeV and a lightest SUSY particle mass of 1 GeV; wino-like chargino-neutralino production for chargino and neutralino masses below 235 GeV with a gravitino mass of 1 GeV; and higgsino-like chargino-neutralino production in the case where the neutralino decays exclusively to a Higgs boson and a gravitino for neutralino masses below 290 GeV.
Search for the decay of the Higgs boson to charm quarks with the ATLAS experiment. A direct search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of charm quarks is presented. Associated production of the Higgs and Z bosons, in the decay mode ZH→l^+l^- c c̅ is studied. A dataset with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC is used. The H→ cc̅ signature is identified using charm tagging algorithms. The observed (expected) upper limit on σ(pp → ZH) ×ℬ(H → cc̅) is 2.7 (3.9^+2.1_-1.1) pb at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, while the Standard Model value is 25.5 fb.

The search is based on 20.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The H^± boson is assumed to be produced via vector-boson fusion and the decays W^±→ qq̅^̅'̅ and Z→ e^+e^-/μ^+μ^- are considered. The search is performed in a range of charged Higgs boson masses from 200 to 1000 GeV. No evidence for the production of an H^± boson is observed. Upper limits of 31–1020 fb at 95

The three final states taunutaunu, taunucs and cscs are considered. No evidence for a signal is found and lower limits are set on the mass M_H+ as a function of the branching fraction B(H to taunu). In the framework of a two-Higgs-doublet model, and assuming B(H+ to taunu + B(H+ to cs) = 1 charged Higgs bosons with masses below 79.3 Gev/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level independently of the branching ratios.

This note presents a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s)=7 TeV using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb-1 collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Over the diphoton mass range 110-150 GeV the maximum deviation from the background-only expectation is observed at 126 GeV with a local significance of 2.8 standard deviations. Taking the look-elsewhere effect into account, the significance is 1.5 standard deviations. The expected cross section exclusion at 95% confidence level varies between 1.6 and 2.9 times the Standard Model cross section over the mass range 110-150 GeV. The observed exclusions lie between 0.9 and 4.0 times the Standard Model cross section, and a Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass range of 114-115 GeV and 135-136 GeV.

The search is performed using three ττ final states, eτ_ h, μτ_ h, and τ_ hτ_ h, where e and μ indicate a τ lepton decaying to lighter leptons and τ_ h indicates a τ decay involving hadrons. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 at 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb^-1.
SM Higgs Combination. The overall combination is presented of six standard model (SM) Higgs boson searches performed by the CMS Collaboration using the following Higgs boson decay signatures: H →γγ, H →ττ, H → WW → 2ℓ 2ν, H → ZZ → 4ℓ, H → ZZ → 2ℓ 2ν, and H → ZZ → 2ℓ 2q.

At 90 The same experimental search results, reinterpreted in the context of the standard model with 4 fermion generations (SM4), allow us to exclude the SM4 Higgs boson with a mass in the range 120-600 GeV/c^2 at 95
Searches for the standard Higgs boson produced in the reaction e^+e^-→ H^0Z.
Search for a massive resonance decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons in the four b quark final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search for a massive resonance decaying into a pair of standard model Higgs bosons, in a final state consisting of two b quark-antiquark pairs, is performed. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The Higgs bosons are highly Lorentz-boosted and are each reconstructed as a single large-area jet. The signal is characterized by a peak in the dijet invariant mass distribution, above a background from the standard model multijet production. The observations are consistent with the background expectations, and are interpreted as upper limits on the products of the s-channel production cross sections and branching fractions of narrow bulk gravitons and radions in warped extra-dimensional models. The limits range from 126 to 1.4 fb at 95% confidence level for resonances with masses between 750 and 3000 GeV, and are the most stringent to date, over the explored mass range.

Search for Higgs Boson Pair Production in the γγ bb̅ Final State using pp Collision Data at √(s)=8TeV from the ATLAS Detector. Searches are performed for resonant and non-resonant Higgs boson pair production in the hh →γγ b b final state using 20 fb^-1 of proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. A 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio of non–resonant production is set at 2.2 pb, while the expected limit is 1.0 pb. The corresponding limit observed for a narrow resonance ranges between 0.8 and 3.5 pb as a function of its mass.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in the H^±→ tb decay channel in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV using the ATLAS detector. A search for charged Higgs bosons heavier than the top quark and decaying via H^±→ tb is presented. The analysis uses 13.2 fb^-1 of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with a top quark and a bottom quark, pp → tbH^±, is explored in the mass range 300 to 1000 GeV using multi-jet final states with one electron or muon from the top-quark decay. Events are categorised according to the multiplicity of jet and b-tagged jets. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate between signal and background events. No significant excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed and upper limits are set on the tbH^± production cross section times the branching fraction BR(H^ ±→ tb), together with their interpretation in benchmark scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into a photon and a hadronically decaying Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This Letter presents a search for the production of new heavy resonances decaying into a Higgs boson and a photon using proton-proton collision data at √(s)=13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. The analysis is performed by reconstructing hadronically decaying Higgs boson (H→ bb̅) candidates as single large-radius jets. A novel algorithm using information about the jet constituents in the center-of-mass frame of the jet is implemented to identify the two b-quarks in the single jet. No significant excess of events is observed above the expected background. Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching fraction for narrow spin-1 resonances decaying into a Higgs boson and a photon in the resonance mass range from 0.7 to 4 TeV, cross-sections times branching fraction are excluded between 11.6 fb and 0.11 fb at a 95% confidence level.
Search for neutral Higgs boson production through the process e+e- → Z^∗ H^0. The results of the searches for neutral Higgs boson production in the process e+e- → Z∗ H^0 are reported, focusing on Higgs boson masses below 70 GeV. The data sample consists of three million hadronic Z decays collected by the L3 experiment at LEP from 1991 through 1994. No signal is found leading to a lower limit on the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson of 60.2 GeV at 95% C.L. These results are also interpreted in the framework of the General Two Doublet Model and limits on the non standard Higgs boson production through the process e+e- → Z∗ H^0 are set. A lower limit of 66.7 GeV at 95% C.L. is obtained for the case where the Higgs decays into an invisible final state.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair in pp collisions at the LHC. A search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair is presented using data samples corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns (5.1 inverse femtobarns) collected in pp collisions at the center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV (8 TeV). Events are considered where the top-quark pair decays to either one lepton+jets (tt̅→ℓν qq̅' bb̅) or dileptons (tt̅→ℓ^+νℓ^-ν̅b b̅), ℓ being an electron or a muon. The search is optimized for the decay mode H → b b̅. The largest background to the t t̅ H signal is top-quark pair production with additional jets. Artificial neural networks are used to discriminate between signal and background events. Combining the results from the 7 TeV and 8 TeV samples, the observed (expected) limit on the cross section for Higgs boson production in association with top-quark pairs for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV is 5.8 (5.2) times the standard model expectation.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks in proton-proton collisions at âs = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector. A search for a Higgs boson produced in association with a pair of top quarks (tt̅H) and decaying into a pair of bottom quarks (H→ bb̅) is presented. The analysis uses 4.7 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s)=7 Tev collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The search is focused on the semileptonic decay mode of the tt̅ system which, together with the H→ bb̅ decay, typically results in a final state signature characterised by one high transverse momentum isolated electron or muon, high transverse missing momentum and six jets, of which four jets originate from b quarks. Events are classified in nine different topologies depending on their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities in order to improve the sensitivity of the search. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is observed and 95% confidence-level upper limits on the production cross section times branching ratio, σ(tt̅H)× BR(H→ bb̅), are derived for a Higgs boson with a mass between 110 and 140 Gev. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 Gev, an observed (expected) 95% confidence-level upper limit of 13.1 (10.5) times the Standard Model cross section is obtained.
Measurement of the Higgs boson production cross section at 7, 8 and 13 TeV center-of-mass energies in the H→γγ channel with the ATLAS detector. Measurements of the fiducial cross section performed in the H→γγ decay channel are presented for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV at the ATLAS experiment. Values for the measured total production cross section for a Standard Model Higgs boson are also given. The signal is extracted using a fit to the diphoton invariant-mass spectrum assuming that the natural width of the resonance is much smaller than the experimental resolution. The signal yield is corrected for the effects of detector efficiency and resolution. The measured cross sections, statistically limited, are in agreement with Standard Model expectation.
First constraints on invisible Higgs boson decays using tt̅H production at √(s)=13 TeV. This document presents first upper bounds on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to invisible particles using an event topology corresponding to production of the Higgs boson in association with a top quark pair. This is done by reinterpreting results of the searches for scalar top quarks performed in the all-hadronic, the semi-leptonic, and the di-leptonic final states. Proton-proton collision data at √(s)=13 TeV is used, recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. An observed (expected) upper limit of ℬ(H→inv)<0.46 (0.48) is set on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decaying to invisible particles at the 95

Search for a vectorlike top partner produced through electroweak interaction and decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson using boosted topologies in the all-hadronic final state. A search is performed for the electroweak production of a vectorlike top quark partner T of charge +2/3 in association with a standard model top or bottom quark, using 2.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment. The search targets T quarks decaying to a top quark and a Higgs boson in a fully hadronic final state. For a T quark with mass above 1 TeV, the daughter top quark and the Higgs boson are highly Lorentz-boosted and each can be reconstructed as a single hadronic jet. Jet substructure and b tagging techniques are used to identify the top quark and Higgs boson jets, and to suppress the standard model backgrounds, which are found to be consistent with observations. Upper limits at 95
Search for exclusive Higgs and Z boson decays to ϕ γ and ρ γ with the ATLAS Detector. A search for the exclusive decays of the Higgs and Z bosons to a ϕ or ρ meson and a photon is performed with a pp collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 35.6 fb^-1 collected at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. These decays have been suggested as a probe of the Higgs boson coupling to light quarks. No significant excess of events is observed above the background, in agreement with the Standard Model expectations. Upper limits at 95
Search for additional heavy neutral Higgs and gauge bosons in the ditau final state produced in 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and for heavy neutral Z^' bosons is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 from proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC during 2015 and 2016. The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to τ^+τ^- with at least one tau lepton decaying to final states with hadrons and a neutrino. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2-2.25 TeV for the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons and 0.2-4.0 TeV for the heavy neutral Z^' boson. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in MSSM and Z^' benchmark scenarios. In the context of the hMSSM scenario, the most stringent limits for the combined search exclude tanβ > 1.0 for m_A = 0.25 TeV and tanβ > 45 for m_A = 1.5 TeV at the 95% confidence level (CL). For the Sequential Standard Model, a Z^'_SSM mass up to 2.42 TeV is excluded at 95% CL and masses up to 2.25-2.60 TeV are excluded for a Z^'_SFM of the Strong Flavour Model.
Searches for the neutral Higgs bosons of the MSSM in e^+ e^- collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 181-184 GeV. The data collected by ALEPH at LEP at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 181 to 184 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 57 pb-1, are analysed to search for pair-produced neutral Higgs bosons h and A, in the b bbar b bbar and tau+ tau- b bbar final states. Two events are found in the data with 2.5 expected from standard model processes. When combined with the lower energy data collected by ALEPH and with earlier reported searches for associated hZ production, these analyses are interpreted in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM). For standard choices of MSSM parameter sets, this combination results in 95% C.L. exclusion lower limits of 72.2 and 76.1 GeV/c2 for mh and mA, irrespective of tan(beta). A scan of the MSSM parameter space is performed in which the model parameters are varied over wide ranges. For low values of , i.e., for 1 < tan(beta) < 2, the limit on mh of 88 GeV/c2 is shown to be robust, being satisfied in essentially all of the physically allowed domain.

Search for Charged Higgs bosons: Combined Results Using LEP data. The four LEP collaborations, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, have searched for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons in the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs). The data of the four experiments are statistically combined. The results are interpreted within the 2HDM for Type I and Type II benchmark scenarios. No statistically significant excess has been observed when compared to the Standard Model background prediction, and the combined LEP data exclude large regions of the model parameter space. Charged Higgs bosons with mass below 80 GeV/c^2 (Type II scenario) or 72.5 GeV/c^2 (Type I scenario, for pseudo-scalar masses above 12 GeV/c^2) are excluded at the 95% confidence level.
Updated coupling measurements of the Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector using up to 25 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. This note presents an update of the measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson using the full run I collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for the channels H→γγ, H→ ZZ^*→4ℓ, H→ WW^*→ℓνℓν, H→ bb, andH→ττ. The combined signal strength is determined to be μ = 1.30 ± 0.12 (stat)^+0.14_-0.11 (sys) at a mass of 125.5 GeV. Evidence for direct decay into fermions is found at the 3.7σ level from the combination of the H→ bb andH→ττ channels with a signal strength of μ_bb,ττ = 1.09 ± 0.24 (stat)^+0.27_-0.21 (sys). Measurements of production and decay mode specific signal strengths and Higgs boson coupling determinations in different benchmark models show good agreement with the Standard Model Higgs boson hypothesis.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into a top-quark and a bottom-quark at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This paper presents a search for charged Higgs bosons heavier than the top quark and decaying into a pair of top and bottom quarks. The data analysed corresponds to 139 fb^â1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC from 2015 to 2018. The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with a top and a bottom quarks, ppâtbH^+âttbb, is explored in the mass range from m(H^±)=200 to 2000 GeV using multi-jet final states with one electron or muon. Events are categorised according to the multiplicity of jets and how likely these are to have originated from hadronisation of a bottom quark. A mass-parameterised neural network is used to discriminate between signal and background events and fitted in four separate signal regions.

A search for heavy resonances decaying into a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at √(s) = 13 TeV is presented. The analysis utilizes the dominant W → q q̅^' or Z → q q̅ and H → b b̅ decays with substructure techniques applied to large-radius jets. A sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector is analyzed and no significant excess of data is observed over the background prediction. The results are interpreted in the context of the Heavy Vector Triplet model with spin-1 W^' and Z^' bosons. Upper limits on the cross section are set for resonances with mass between 1.5 and 5.0 TeV, ranging from 6.8 to 0.53 fb for W^'→ WH and from 8.7 to 0.53 fb for Z^'→ ZH at the 95% confidence level.
Search for the minimal standard model Higgs boson in e+e- collisions at LEP.
Cross-section measurements of the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of τ-leptons in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A measurement of production cross sections of the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions is presented in the H→ττ decay channel. The analysis is performed using 36.1 fb^-1 of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV. All combinations of leptonic (τ→ l νν̅ with l = e, μ) and hadronic (τ→ hadrons ν) tau decays are considered. The H→ττ signal over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is established with an observed (expected) significance of 4.4 (4.1) standard deviations. Combined with results obtained using data taken at 7 and 8 TeV center-of-mass energies, the observed (expected) significance amounts to 6.4 (5.4) standard deviations and constitutes an observation of H→ττ decays. Using the data taken at √(s)=13 TeV, the total cross section in the H→ττ decay channel is measured to be 3.77^+0.60_-0.59(stat.)^+0.87_-0.74(syst.) pb, for a Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV assuming the relative contributions of its production modes as predicted by the Standard Model. Total cross sections in the H→ττ decay channel are determined separately for vector-boson-fusion production and gluon-gluon-fusion production to be 0.28 ± 0.09(stat.)^+0.11_-0.09(syst.) pb and 3.1 ± 1.0(stat.)^+1.6_-1.3(syst.) pb, respectively. Similarly, results of a fit are reported in the framework of simplified template cross sections. All measurements are in agreement with Standard Model expectations.
Search for heavy resonances decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in the (ll, lnu, nunu) bb final state. A search for heavy resonances in final states with a Higgs boson and a vector boson, performed using 2.17–2.52 fb^-1 of data collected in 2015 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV, is presented. The leptonic vector boson decays (Z→νν, W→ℓν, and Z→ℓℓ, with ℓ = e,μ) are considered, while the Higgs boson is reconstructed from high-momentum b quark pairs and detected as a single massive jet. The discriminating power of the jet mass distribution and b tagging are exploited to suppress the amount of background from known standard model processes. The signal is characterized as a peak in the distribution of a kinematic variable related to the resonance mass and defined according to the considered final state. The result is consistent with the standard model prediction, and interpreted in terms of a benchmark model with a heavy vector triplet, as predicted in many scenarios of physics beyond the standard model.
Test of CP invariance in vector-boson fusion production of the Higgs boson in the H→ττ channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A test of CP invariance in Higgs boson production via vector-boson fusion is performed in the H→ττ decay channel. This test uses the Optimal Observable method and is carried out using 36.1 fb^-1 of √(s) = 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Contributions from CP-violating interactions between the Higgs boson and electroweak gauge bosons are described by an effective field theory, in which the parameter d̃ governs the strength of CP violation. No sign of CP violation is observed in the distributions of the Optimal Observable, and d̃ is constrained to the interval [-0.090, 0.035] at the 68% confidence level (CL), compared to an expected interval of d̃∈ [-0.035,0.033] based upon the Standard Model prediction. No constraints can be set on d̃ at 95% CL, while an expected 95% CL interval of d̃∈ [-0.21,0.15] for the Standard Model hypothesis was expected.
A search for the dimuon decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector. A search for the dimuon decay of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson is performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in Run2 pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. The observed (expected) significance over the background-only hypothesis for a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09 GeV is 2.0σ (1.7σ). The observed upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio for pp → H →μμ is 2.2 times the SM prediction at 95% confidence level, while the expected limit on a H →μμ signal assuming the absence (presence) of a SM signal is 1.1 (2.0). The best-fit value of the signal strength parameter, defined as the ratio of the observed signal yield to the one expected in the SM, is μ = 1.2 ± 0.6.
Search for dark matter in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two photons at √(s)= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for dark matter in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two photons is presented. This study is based on data collected with the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1ââfb-1 of proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13Â TeV in 2015 and 2016. No significant excess over the expected background is observed. Upper limits at 95%Â confidence level are set on the visible cross section for beyond the Standard Model physics processes, and the production cross section times branching fraction of the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into two photons in association with missing transverse momentum in three different benchmark models. Limits at 95%Â confidence level are also set on the observed signal in two-dimensional mass planes. Additionally, the results are interpreted in terms of 90%Â confidence-level limits on the dark-matterânucleon scattering cross section, as a function of the dark-matter particle mass, for a spin-independent scenario.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion and decaying to bb with proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. A search for a standard model Higgs boson (H) that is produced through vector boson fusion and decays to a bottom-quark pair is performed using proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb^-1 recorded in 2015 with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The observed 95 production of a H→bb signal at a mass of 125 GeV is 3.0 times the standard model expectation, compared to 5.0 expected in absence of a signal. The combination of this result with the previous CMS search using proton-proton collisions at √(s)=8 TeV yields an observed 95 signal production of 3.4 times the standard model expectation, where 2.2 is expected in the absence of signal, and a corresponding fitted signal strength μ=σ/σ_SM=1.3^+1.2_-1.1.
Search for the neutral Higgs boson from Z0 decay in the Higgs mass range between 11 and 24 GeV.
Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel with 36 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Properties of the Higgs boson are measured in the two-photon final state using 36.1ââfb-1 of protonâproton collision data recorded at s=13ââTeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Cross-section measurements for the production of a Higgs boson through gluonâgluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, and in association with a vector boson or a top-quark pair are reported. The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the observed to the expected signal yield, is measured for each of these production processes as well as inclusively. The global signal strength measurement of 0.99Â±0.14 improves on the precision of the ATLAS measurement at s=7 and 8Â TeV by a factor of two. Measurements of gluonâgluon fusion and vector-boson fusion productions yield signal strengths compatible with the Standard Model prediction. Measurements of simplified template cross sections, designed to quantify the different Higgs boson production processes in specific regions of phase space, are reported. The cross section for the production of the Higgs boson decaying to two isolated photons in a fiducial region closely matching the experimental selection of the photons is measured to be 55Â±10ââfb, which is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 64Â±2ââfb. Furthermore, cross sections in fiducial regions enriched in Higgs boson production in vector-boson fusion or in association with large missing transverse momentum, leptons or top-quark pairs are reported. Differential and double-differential measurements are performed for several variables related to the diphoton kinematics as well as the kinematics and multiplicity of the jets produced in association with a Higgs boson. These differential cross sections are sensitive to higher order QCD corrections and properties of the Higgs boson, such as its spin and CP quantum numbers. No significant deviations from a wide array of Standard Model predictions are observed. Finally, the strength and tensor structure of the Higgs boson interactions are investigated using an effective Lagrangian, which introduces additional CP-even and CP-odd interactions. No significant new physics contributions are observed.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H to WW to lvjj decay channel. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to two W bosons with the subsequent decay to a final state containing one lepton, one neutrino, and two or three jets is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV and collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC.

Search for Higgs boson pair production in the bb̅ bb̅ final state from pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs boson pair production pp → hh is performed with 19.5 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at √(s)= 8 TeV, which were recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. The decay products of each Higgs boson are reconstructed as a high-momentum bb̅ system with either a pair of small-radius jets or a single large-radius jet, the latter exploiting jet substructure techniques and associated b-tagged track-jets. No evidence for resonant or non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is observed. The data are interpreted in the context of the Randall–Sundrum model with a warped extra dimension as well as the two-Higgs-doublet model. An upper limit on the cross-section for pp → G^*_KK→ hh → bb̅ bb̅ of 3.2 (2.3) fb is set for a Kaluza–Klein graviton G^*_KK mass of 1.0 (1.5) TeV, at the 95
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with W or Z bosons, and decaying to bottom quarks for LHCp 2013.

Search for a neutral MSSM Higgs boson decaying into ττ with 12.9 fb^-1 of data at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for a neutral Higgs boson is presented, using the decay into two tau leptons. The analysis uses 12.9 fb^-1 of pp collision data collected by CMS in 2016, at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV. The results are interpreted in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. No excess above the expectation from the standard model is found and upper limits are set on the production cross sections times branching fraction for masses between 90 and 3200 GeV. Regions of phase space of two different benchmark scenarios are also excluded.
Search for heavy Higgs bosons decaying to a top quark pair in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. Multiple new-physics models extending the standard model predict the existence of additional scalar (H) or pseudoscalar (A) Higgs bosons. In this note, a search is presented for such new bosons decaying to a top quark pair in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data set analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. Final states with one or two charged leptons are considered, where the lepton may be a muon or an electron. The invariant mass of the reconstructed top quark pair system and variables that are sensitive to the spin of the particles decaying into the top quark pair are used to search for signatures of the H or A bosons. The strength of the coupling of the hypothetical bosons to the top quark is probed as a function of the mass and width of the boson. The interference with the standard model top quark pair background is taken into account explicitly. The results are interpreted in a model-independent way as well as in a minimal supersymmetric standard model framework.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying via H^±→τν in tt̅ events using pp collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The results of a search for charged Higgs bosons are presented. The analysis is based on 4.6/fb of proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, using top quark pair events with a tau lepton in the final state. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard Model processes. Assuming that the branching ratio of the charged Higgs boson to a tau lepton and a neutrino is 100%, this leads to upper limits on the branching ratio of top quark decays to a b quark and a charged Higgs boson between 5% and 1% for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 90 GeV to 160 GeV, respectively. In the context of the mh-max scenario of the MSSM, tan(beta) above 12-26, as well as between 1 and 2-6, can be excluded for charged Higgs boson masses between 90 GeV and 150 GeV.
Flavour Independent Search for Neutral Higgs Bosons at LEP. A flavour independent search for the CP-even and CP-odd neutral Higgs bosons h and A is performed in 624/pb of data collected with the L3 detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209GeV. Higgs boson production through the e^+e^- -> Z h and the e^+e^- ->h A processes is considered and decays of the Higgs bosons into hadrons are studied. No significant signal is observed and 95% confidence level limits on the hZZ and hAZ couplings are derived as a function of the Higgs boson masses. Assuming the Standard Model cross section for the Higgs-strahlung process and a 100% branching fraction into hadrons, a 95% confidence level lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson is set at 110.3GeV.
Search for heavy Higgs bosons A/H decaying to a top quark pair in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for heavy pseudoscalar (A) and scalar (H) Higgs bosons decaying into a top quark pair (ttÂ¯) has been performed with 20.3ââfb-1 of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy s=8ââTeV. Interference effects between the signal process and standard model ttÂ¯ production, which are expected to distort the signal shape from a single peak to a peak-dip structure, are taken into account. No significant deviation from the standard model prediction is observed in the ttÂ¯ invariant mass spectrum in final states with an electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets. The results are interpreted within the context of a type-II two-Higgs-doublet model. Exclusion limits on the signal strength are derived as a function of the mass mA/H and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs fields, tanÎ², for mA/H>500ââGeV.
Searches for Neutral Higgs Bosons in Extended Models. Searches for neutral Higgs bosons produced at LEP in association with Z bosons, in pairs and in the Yukawa process are presented in this paper. Higgs boson decays into b quarks, tau leptons, or other Higgs bosons are considered, giving rise to four-b, four-b+jets, six-b and four-tau final states, as well as mixed modes with b quarks and tau leptons. The whole mass domain kinematically accessible at LEP in these topologies is searched. The analysed data set covers both the LEP1 and LEP2 energy ranges and exploits most of the luminosity recorded by the DELPHI experiment. No convincing evidence for a signal is found, and results are presented in the form of mass-dependent upper bounds on coupling factors (in units of model-independent reference cross-sections) for all processes, allowing interpretation of the data in a large class of models.
Search for dark matter particles produced in association with the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for dark matter (DM) particles is performed using events with a Higgs boson candidate and a large missing transverse momentum. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search is performed in five Higgs boson decay channels: a b quark-antiquark pair, a pair of τ leptons, a pair of photons, or a pair of W or Z bosons. No significant excesses over the expected standard model background are observed in any of the five channels. The results from the individual channels are combined to maximize the sensitivity of the search, which allows to set most stringent limits on DM production in the context of two benchmark simplified models. The results are further reinterpreted in terms of spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section and compared to those from direct-detection DM experiments. This is the first search for DM particles produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W or Z bosons, and the first combination based on five Higgs boson decay channels.
Search for a Higgs boson decaying into a Z and a photon in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson and a photon is described. The analysis is performed using protonâproton collision datasets recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. Events were collected at center-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.0 fbâ1 and 19.6 fbâ1, respectively. The selected events are required to have opposite-sign electron or muon pairs. No excess above standard model predictions has been found in the 120â160 GeV mass range and the first limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times the HâZÎ³ branching fraction at the LHC have been derived. The observed at 95% confidence level limits are between about 4 and 25 times the standard model cross section times the branching fraction. For a standard model Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV the expected limit at the 95% confidence level is 10 and the observed limit is 9.5. Models predicting the Higgs boson production cross section times the HâZÎ³ branching fraction to be larger than one order of magnitude of the standard model prediction are excluded for most of the 125â157 GeV mass range.

A search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into a top and a bottom quark-antiquark pair in the fully hadronic final state is presented. The analysis uses LHC proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 at √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. No significant deviation above the expected background is observed. Model-independent upper limits at 95
Search for Higgs boson decays to Beyond-the-Standard-Model light bosons in four-lepton events with the ATLAS detector at √(s)=13 TeV. A search is conducted for a new Beyond-the-Standard-Model dark vector boson or a new light pseudoscalar boson using events where a Higgs boson with mass 125 GeV decays to four leptons (ℓ = e or μ). This decay is presumed to occur via an intermediate state which contains one or two on-shell, promptly decaying bosons: H→ ZZ_d→ 4ℓ or H→ Z_dZ_d → 4ℓ, or via two light pseudoscalar bosons : H→ aa → 4μ. The search uses pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 at the centre-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV. Dedicated selections are defined for each of the three decay channels. For the first case, a total of 102 events are observed with 87± 7 predicted by the Standard Model in a search region sensitive to bosons with a mass between 15 GeV and 55 GeV across the 2ℓ2μ and 2ℓ 2e decay channels. For the second case, which is performed in a search region sensitive to bosons with a mass between 15 GeV and 60 GeV, a total of 6 events are observed across the 4e, 2e2μ and 4μ decay channels, with a Standard Model prediction of 3.9 ± 0.3. The search is extended to boson masses between 1 GeV and 15 GeV, excluding masses close to known dilepton mass resonances, for 4μ final states only. In this extended search region, no events are observed with a prediction of 0.4±0.1. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on model-independent fiducial cross sections, and on the Higgs boson decay branching ratios to vector and pseudoscalar bosons in two benchmark models.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H->WW->llnunu decay mode using 1.7 fb-1 of data collected with the ATLAS detector at sqrt(s)=7 TeV. A Higgs boson search in the H->WW->llnunu (l=e,mu) decay mode has been performed using 1.7 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector. No significant evidence of a Standard Model Higgs boson is found. An upper bound is placed on the Higgs boson production cross-section as a function of m_H. A Higgs boson with a mass in the range from 154 GeV to 186 GeV is excluded at 95% Confidence Level, while the expected exclusion range is 135 <= m_H <= 196 GeV.
Search for H→γγ produced in association with top quarks and constraints on the top quark-Higgs boson Yukawa coupling using data taken at 7 TeV and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is performed for Higgs bosons produced in association with top quarks using the diphoton decay mode of the Higgs boson. Selection requirements are optimized separately for leptonic and fully hadronic final states from the top quark decays. The dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and 4.5 fb^-1 at 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess over the background prediction is observed and upper limits are set on the tt̅H production cross section. The observed exclusion upper limit at 95% confidence level is 6.5 times the predicted Standard Model value. In addition, lower and upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the top quark-Higgs boson Yukawa coupling strength parameter taking into account the changes in the ttH and tH cross sections as well as the H→γγ branching fraction. A lower limit at 95% confidence level of -1.3 is observed as well as an upper limit of +8.1.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- collisions at centre-of-mass energies from 130 to 172 GeV. The data collected at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 130 to 172 GeV by ALEPH at LEP, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 27.5 pb-1, are analysed in a search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons H+-. Three analyses are employed to select the tau nu tau nu, tau nu c s and c s c s final states. No evidence for a signal is found. Mass limits are set as a function of the branching fraction BR for H+- -> tau nu. Charged Higgs bosons with masses below 52 GeV are excluded at 95% C.L. independently of BR, thus significantly improving on existing mass limits from LEP1 searches.
Search for Higgs Decays to New Light Bosons in Boosted Tau Final States. A search for non-standard decays of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson to pairs of light bosons, as predicted in models with extended Higgs sectors, is presented. In two Higgs doublet models, including the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model, the Higgs can decay into a pair of light scalars h or pseudoscalars a. In this search, the gluon fusion, W and Z associated Higgs, and vector boson fusion production channels for the Higgs are all considered, and the decay H→aa(hh) with a(h)→ττ is reconstructed from the tau decay products. The final state is characterized by one isolated high p_T muon plus at least one highly boosted pair of taus, of which one of the taus is required to decay to a muon. Using 19.7 fb^-1 of 8 TeV center of mass pp collision data recorded by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, a counting experiment is performed in a region of high di-tau invariant mass. No excess of events above the Standard Model backgrounds is found, and upper limits are set on the branching ratio BR(H→aa/hh)BR^2(a/h→ττ).
Search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to γγ or τ^+τ^- at √(s)=13 TeV with the CMS detector. A search for dark matter is performed by looking for events in pp collisions with large missing transverse momentum and a recoiling Higgs boson that decays to either a pair of photons or a pair of tau leptons. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess over the expected standard model background is observed. Results are interpreted in the context of two benchmark simplified models. Upper limits with 95
A search for neutral Higgs bosons in the MSSM and models with two scalar field doublets. A search is described for the neutral Higgs bosons h^0 and A^0 predicted by models with two scalar field doublets and, in particular, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The search in the Z^0 h^0 and h^0 A^0 production channels is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25 pb^-1 from e^+e^- collisions at centre-of-mass energies between 130 and 172GeV collected with the OPAL detector at LEP. The observation of a number of candidates consistent with Standard Model background expectations is used in combination with earlier results from data collected at the Z^0 resonance to set limits on m_h and m_A in general models with two scalar field doublets and in the MSSM. For example, in the MSSM, for tan(beta) > 1, minimal and maximal scalar top quark mixing and soft SUSY-breaking masses of 1 TeV, the 95% confidence level limits m_h > 59.0 GeV and m_A > 59.5 GeV are obtained. For the first time, the MSSM parameter space is explored in a detailed scan.
Observation of an Excess of Events in the Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A preliminary combined search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The pp collisions datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.6 fb-1 to 4.9 fb-1 at √(s)=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb-1 to 5.9 fb-1 at √(s)=8 TeV in 2012. Searches for H →γγ, H → ZZ^(*), H → WW^(*), H → bb̅, and H →τ^+τ^- have been performed on the 2011 data, while only the H →γγ and H → ZZ^(*) searches are improved compared to previous analyses and use both the 2011 and 2012 data. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at the 95% confidence level for masses in the range 110 GeV to 122.6 GeV and 129.7 GeV to 558 GeV. An excess of events is observed for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis near 126.5 GeV. The local significance of this excess is 5.0σ, where the expected significance in the presence of a Standard Model Higgs boson for that mass hypothesis is 4.6σ.
Search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson or dark matter candidates produced in association with a Z boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson or dark matter candidates produced in association with a leptonically decaying Z boson in protonâproton collisions at s=13Â TeV is presented. This search uses 36.1Â fbâ1 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant deviation from the expectation of the Standard Model backgrounds is observed. Assuming the Standard Model ZH production cross-section, an observed (expected) upper limit of 67% (39%) at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio of invisible decays of the Higgs boson with mass mH=125Â GeV . The corresponding limits on the production cross-section of the ZH process with the invisible Higgs boson decays are also presented. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the dark matter candidate and mediator masses are reported in the framework of simplified dark matter models.

No evidence is found for a significant deviation from SM expectations and an upper limit is placed at 95 for a SM Higgs mass in the range 190 < m_ H < 500.
Search for Higgs boson pair production in the final state containing two photons and two bottom quarks in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search is presented for the production of a pair of Higgs bosons, where one decays into two photons and the other to two bottom quarks. Both resonant and nonresonant production mechanisms of the Higgs boson pair are investigated. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data from the LHC at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector in 2016, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The observed data are in agreement with standard model predictions. Upper limits on the production cross sections of spin-0 and spin-2 particles are set at 95
Search for bottom-squark pair production with the ATLAS detector in final states containing Higgs bosons, b-jets and missing transverse momentum. The result of a search for the pair production of the supersymmetric partner of the bottom-quark (b̃) using 139 fb^-1 of data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector in Run 2 is reported. In the supersymmetric scenarios considered, each of the bottom-squarks decay to a b-quark and the second lightest neutralino, b̃→ b + χ̃_2^0. Each χ̃_2^0 is assumed to subsequently decay with 100% branching ratio to the Standard-Model-like Higgs boson (h) and the lightest neutralino: χ̃_2^0→ h + χ̃_1^0. The χ̃_1^0 is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and is stable. Two signal mass configurations are targeted: the first has a constant LSP mass of 60 GeV; and the second has a constant mass difference between the χ̃_2^0 and χ̃_1^0 of 130 GeV. The final states considered contain no charged leptons, three or more b-jets, and large missing transverse momentum. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model background expectation is observed in any of the signal regions considered. Limits at the 95% confidence level are placed in the supersymmetric models considered, and bottom-squarks with mass up to 1.45 TeV are excluded.

Determination of spin and parity of the Higgs boson in the WW^*→ e νμν decay channel with the ATLAS detector. Studies of the spin and parity quantum numbers of the Higgs boson in the WW^* → e νμν final state Â are presented,Â based on proton–proton collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding toÂ an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=8 TeV. The Standard Model spin-parity J^CP = 0^++ hypothesis is compared withÂ alternative hypotheses for both spin and CP. The case where the observed resonance is a mixture of the Standard-Model-like Higgs boson and CP-evenÂ (J^CP = 0^++) or Â CP-odd (J^CP = 0^+-) Higgs boson in scenarios beyond the Standard Model is also studied. Â The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model prediction and limits are placed on alternative spin and CP hypotheses, including CP mixing in different scenarios.Â
First results on Higgs to WW at √(s)=13 TeV. The first results on the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W-boson pair at √(s)=13 TeV at the LHC are reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 ± 0.1 fb^-1, collected by the CMS detector in 2015. The W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with an oppositely charged eμ pair and large missing transverse momentum in association with up to one jet. The observed (expected) significance for the SM Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV is 0.7σ (2.0σ), corresponding to an observed cross section times branching ratio of 0.3 ± 0.5 times the standard model prediction.
Search for heavy resonances decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons in the four b quark final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for heavy resonances decaying into pairs of standard model Higgs bosons is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The final state consists of both Higgs bosons decaying to b quark-antiquark pairs. For resonance masses above 1 TeV the Higgs bosons are Lorentz-boosted and each H→ bb is reconstructed as one hadronic jet. The signal is characterized as a peak over the invariant mass spectrum of dijet events from standard model multijet processes. The signal strengths for different assumptions of resonance masses are estimated by a combined likelihood fit of the background and the signal shapes to the data. The results are consistent with the standard model expectations, and are interpreted as upper limits on the s-channel production cross sections of narrow bulk gravitons and scalar radions in warped extra-dimensional models for resonance masses between 800 and 3000 GeV.
Higgs to WW measurements with 15.2 fb^-1 of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions. Results on the measurements of the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W-boson pair at √(s)=13 TeV at the LHC with 2015 and early 2016 data are reported. The event sample corresponds to integrated luminosities of 2.3 fb^-1 and 12.9 fb^-1, collected by the CMS detector in 2015 and up to August 2016 respectively. The W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with an oppositely charged eμ pair and large missing transverse momentum, and with different number of jets. Dedicated categories with two jets or three leptons, designed to select Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion or associated production with a W or Z boson, are also explored. Combining all the channels studied, the observed (expected) significance for the SM Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV is 4.3σ (4.1σ), corresponding to an observed cross section times branching ratio of 1.05 ± 0.26 times the standard model prediction.
Constraints on new phenomena via Higgs boson couplings and invisible decays with the ATLAS detector. The ATLAS experiment at the LHC has measured the Higgs boson couplings and mass, and searched for invisible Higgs boson decays, using multiple production and decay channels with up to 4.7 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s)=7 TeV and 20.3 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV. In the current study, the measured production and decay rates of the observed Higgs boson in the γγ, ZZ, WW, Zγ, bb, ττ, and μμ decay channels, along with results from the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top-quark pair, are used to probe the scaling of the couplings with mass. Limits are set on parameters in extensions of the Standard Model including a composite Higgs boson, an additional electroweak singlet, and two-Higgs-doublet models. Together with the measured mass of the scalar Higgs boson in the γγ and ZZ decay modes, a lower limit is set on the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass of m_A>370 GeV in the “hMSSM” simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Results from direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons are also interpreted in the hMSSM. Direct searches for invisible Higgs boson decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a Higgs boson with W/Z (Z→ ll, W/Z → jj) modes are statistically combined to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of 0.25. The use of the measured visible decay rates in a more general coupling fit improves the upper limit to 0.23, constraining a Higgs portal model of dark matter.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W pair in the fully leptonic final state in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to W^+W^- in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV is reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.1±0.2 fb^-1, collected by the CMS detector at the LHC. The W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with two opposite charged leptons and large missing transverse momentum. Upper limits on the Higgs boson production relative to the standard model Higgs expectation are derived. The standard model Higgs boson is excluded in the mass range 129–520 GeV at 95
Search for the minimal Standard Model Higgs boson.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in produced in association with a vector boson and decaying to bottom quarks with the ATLAS detector. This note presents an updated search with the ATLAS experiment for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a W or Z boson and decaying to bb̅ using 4.7 of LHC proton-proton data at and 13.0 at . The search is performed using events containing zero, one or two electrons or muons targeting the three decay modes , and ZH →ℓ^+ℓ^- bb̅. No significant excess is observed. For m_H = 125 GeV, the observed (expected) upper 95
Combination of the Searches for the Higgs Boson in 1 fbâ1 of Data Taken with the ATLAS Detector at 7 TeV Center-of-Mass Energy. This note presents the result of the combination of the searches for the Standard Model Higgs boson using 1.0 fb-1 of data taken with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. No clear evidence for a signal is observed and the mass ranges 155 GeV to 210 GeV and 290 GeV to 400 GeV are excluded at 95% CL. In the mass ranges 140 GeV to 210 GeV and 290 GeV to 400 GeV the median result would have excluded the Standard Model Higgs boson at 95% CL. The data are also used to set limits on a Standard Model Higgs boson in the presence of a fourth generation of heavy quarks and leptons. In this model the excluded region covers from 125 GeV to 500 GeV.
Search for Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to Two Photons. The results of a search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson where the Higgs boson decays to two photons are presented. The analysis is based on the data collected in 2015 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in proton-proton collisions with the CMS detector at the LHC. A two-Higgs-doublet model is taken as the benchmark model. After the final selection, using a dataset of 2.3 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity, no significant evidence for dark matter particle production has been observed. For the benchmark model, limits on the cross section times branching ratio for dark matter production are placed at approximately 3 fb for the Z^' mass range of 600 to 2500 GeV.
Measurements of the properties of the Higgs-like boson in the four lepton decay channel with the ATLAS detector using 25 fbâ1 of proton-proton collision data. This note presents an update of the search results and property measurements of the observed Higgs-like boson in the decay channel H â ZZ(â) â l+lâlâ²+lâ²â, where l, lâ² = e or Î¼, using proton-proton collision data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.6 fbâ1 and 20.7 fbâ1at âs = 7 TeV and âs = 8 TeV, respectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A clear excess of events over the background is observed at mH = 124.3 GeV in the combined analysis of the two datasets with a significance of 6.6 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 2.7 Ã 10â11. The mass of the Higgs-like boson is measured to be mH = 124.3+0.6-0.5 (stat)+0.5-0.3 (syst) GeV, and the signal strength (the ratio of the observed cross section to the expected SM cross section) at this mass is found to be Î¼ = 1.7+0.5-0.4. A study of Higgs boson production mechanisms allows a first measurement of couplings with this channel. A spin-parity analysis is performed on the events with reconstructed four-lepton invariant mass m4l satisfying 115 GeV < m4l < 130 GeV. The Higgs-like boson is found to be compatible with the SM expectation of 0+ when compared pair-wise with 0â , 1+ , 1â , 2+ , and 2â . The 0â and 1+ states are excluded at the 97.8% confidence level or higher using CLS in favour of 0+.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks and decaying into bb in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This preliminary result has been removed because a problem was found in the tt̅H, H→ bb̅ 2-lepton channel.
Search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalars with two muons and two b jets in the final state at sqrts = 13 TeV. A search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar particles a_1 is performed under the hypothesis that one of the pseudoscalars decays to a pair of opposite sign muons and the other decays to a bb pair. Such signatures are predicted in a number of extensions of the standard model (SM), including next-to-minimal supersymmetry and two-Higgs-doublet models with an additional scalar singlet. A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 is studied. No statistically significant excess is observed with respect to the SM backgrounds in the search region for pseudoscalar masses from 20 GeV to half of the Higgs boson mass. Upper limits at 95
Search for Higgs boson pair production in the bb̅WW^∗ decay mode at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs boson pair production in the bb̅WW^* decay mode is performed in the bb̅lν qq final state using 36.1 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of events beyond the background expectation is found. Upper limits on the non-resonant pp→ HH production cross section of 10 pb and on the resonant production cross section as a function of the HH invariant mass are obtained. Resonant production limits are set for scalar and spin-2 graviton hypotheses in the mass range 500 to 3000 GeV.
Search for the Higgs boson in the ZZ* decay channel with the CMS experiment. A study of the sensitivity for the inclusive production of Standard Model Higgs bosons H decaying in ZZ^(*) pairs is presented with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC pp collider at 14 TeV centre of mass energy, for the integrated luminosity of 1 fb^-1. The analysis is performed for the leptonic decay channels H→ Z Z^(*)→ 4ℓ with ℓ = e, μ and for a mass m_ H in the range from 120 to 250. Signal and background datasets obtained with a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the detector response, including the limited inter-calibration and alignment precision expected at startup luminosities, are treated using a complete reconstruction chain. A simple m_ H independent sequence of cuts is established which provides a clean sample of 4ℓ events while preserving the highest signal detection efficiency. A signal with a significance above 2 standard deviations is found unlikely for a Higgs boson with a mass m_ H lying anywhere in the mass range considered. In absence of significant deviations from background expectations, upper limits on the production cross-section of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson can be established. The limits extend beyond existing constraints.
Search for the standard model Higgs Boson in the decay channel H to ZZ(*) to q qbar l-l+ at CMS. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to two Z bosons with subsequent decay to a final state containing two leptons and two quark-jets, HZZ^(*)qq̅ℓ^-ℓ^+ is presented. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV and collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Selections to discriminate between signal and background events are based on kinematic and topological quantities including the angular spin correlations of the decay products. Events are further classified for analysis according to probability of the jets to originate from quarks of light or heavy flavor or from gluons. No evidence for a Higgs boson is found and upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section are set in the range of masses between 130 GeV and 600 GeV.
Measurements of gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion Higgs boson production cross-sections in the H → WW^∗→ eνμν decay channel in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Higgs boson production cross-sections in proton-proton collisions are measured in the H → WW^∗→ eνμν decay channel. The proton–proton collision data were produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1. The product of the H → WW^∗ branching fraction times the gluon–gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion cross-sections are measured to be 11.4 ^+1.2_-1.1 (stat.) ^+1.8_-1.7(syst.) pb and 0.50 ^+0.24_-0.22 (stat.) ± 0.17(syst.) pb, respectively, in agreement with Standard Model predictions.
Searches for Higgs bosons.
A measurement of the Higgs boson mass in the diphoton decay channel. A measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel is presented. This analysis is based on 35.9 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected during the 2016 LHC running period, with the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. A refined detector calibration and new analysis techniques have been used to improve the precision of this measurement. The Higgs boson mass is measured to be m_H = 125.78 ± 0.26 GeV. This is combined with a measurement of m_H already performed in the H → ZZ → 4 ℓ decay channel using the same data set, giving m_H = 125.46 ± 0.16 GeV. This result, when further combined with an earlier measurement of m_H using data collected in 2011 and 2012 with the CMS detector, gives a value for the Higgs boson mass of m_H = 125.38 ± 0.14 GeV. This is currently the most precise measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson.
Combined measurements of Higgs boson production and decay using up to 80 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS experiment. Combined measurements of Higgs boson production cross-sections, branching fractions and couplings are presented in the Higgs boson decay channels into γγ, ZZ^*, WW^*, ττ, μμ and bb̅, using up to 79.8 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS experiment. Results are presented for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes, and associated production with vector bosons or top quarks. The combined measurement yields an observed (expected) significance for the vector-boson fusion production process of 6.5σ (5.3σ). This single-experiment observation follows an earlier observation in the combination of ATLAS and CMS measurements. The results are interpreted in terms of modifiers applied to the Standard Model couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles, and are used to set exclusion limits on new phenomena. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed.
Search for heavy resonances decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons in four b quark final state in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV. A search for heavy resonances decaying to a pair of standard model Higgs bosons (H) is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb^-1. The final state under consideration consists of both Higgs bosons decaying to b quark-antiquark pairs. For resonance masses above 1 TeV the Higgs bosons are highly Lorentz-boosted and thus each H→ bb is usually reconstructed as one hadronic jet. The signal is characterized as a peak in the distribution of the invariant mass of such dijet candidates. The background consists mostly of standard model multijet processes. The signal strength for different assumed resonance masses is estimated by a combined likelihood fit of background and signal shapes to the data. The data are found to be consistent with the standard model, and upper limits on the s-channel production cross sections of narrow bulk gravitons and scalar radions in warped extradimensional models are reported.
Evidence for associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark pair in final states with electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying τ leptons at √(s) = 13 TeV. Results of a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top quark pair ( ttH ) in final states with electrons, muons, and hadronically decaying Ï leptons are presented. The analyzed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^â1 recorded in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV by the CMS experiment in 2016. The sensitivity of the search is improved by using matrix element and machine learning methods to separate the signal from backgrounds. The measured signal rate amounts to 1.23_ââ0.43^+â0.45 times the production rate expected in the standard model, with an observed (expected) significance of 3.2Ï (2.8Ï), which represents evidence for ttH production in those final states. An upper limit on the signal rate of 2.1 times the standard model production rate is set at 95% confidence level.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H to WW to lnujj decay channel in pp collisions at the LHC. A search for a standard model-like Higgs boson decaying to two W bosons with the subsequent decay to a final state containing one lepton, one neutrino, and two jets is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=8 TeV and 5 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. Selections to discriminate between the signal and background events are based on kinematic and topological quantities including the angular spin correlations between the decay products. A standard model-like Higgs boson is excluded in the mass ranges 170–180 GeV and 230–545 GeV at 95 170–180 GeV and 255–565 GeV. The results are also interpreted within the framework of an effective theory that predicts the existence of two Higgs-like scalar particles, one with M∼ 126 GeV, and one that is heavier, which together accomplish the unitarization of the WW scattering cross section.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and constraints on its couplings from a combined ATLAS and CMS analysis of the LHC pp collision data at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes and of the H → ZZ, WW, γγ, ττ, bb and μμ decay modes. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined Higgs boson mass measurement by ATLAS and CMS. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision datasets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV and 20 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8 TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates of the two experiments are combined within the context of two generic parameterisations: one based on ratios of cross sections and branching ratios and the other based on ratios of coupling modifiers, introduced within the context of a leading-order Higgs boson coupling framework. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model expectation is measured to be 1.09 ± 0.11 and the combination of the two experiments leads to observed significances of the VBF production process and of the H→ττ decay at the level of 5.4σ and 5.5σ, respectively. Several interpretations of the results with more model-dependent parameterisations, derived from the generic ones, are also given. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.
Search for Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Dark Higgs Boson Decaying to W^± W^∓ or ZZ in Fully Hadronic Final States Using pp Collisions at √(s)=13 TeV Recorded with the ATLAS Detector. Several extensions of the Standard Model predict the production of dark matter particles at the LHC. A pioneering search is performed for dark matter particles produced in association with a Dark Higgs boson s decaying to VV where V=W^±,Z, using 139 fb^-1 of pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC. The s→ V(qq̅)V(qq̅) decays are reconstructed with a novel technique using reclustered jets with a cone parameter R=0.8 based on R=0.4 calorimeter jets and tracking information. The observed data are found to agree with Standard Model predictions.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- collisions at √(s) = 172 GeV. This paper presents results on charged Higgs boson production, based on LEP data collected at √(s) = 172 GeV, that complement the previous DELPHI results obtained at centre of mass energies up to 161 GeV. %The analysis is based on LEP data collected at √(s) = 172 GeV. The charged Higgs bosons are assumed to be pair produced and to decay either into a quark pair %, identified as cs, or into τν_τ. The three different possible final states are included in the analysis. Data from ring imaging Cherenkov and microvertex detectors are used to identify the quarks as a cs pair. %No significant signal was found. The number of candidates found is compatible with the background expected from standard processes. Combining the results of the present analysis with those of the previous analysis at lower energies, a new lower mass limit for the charged Higgs boson is set at 54.5 GeV/c^2.
Search for Neutral Higgs Bosons Decaying to Tau Pairs in pp Collisions at sqrts=7 TeV. A search for neutral Higgs bosons in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb^-1 recorded by the CMS experiment. The search uses decays of the Higgs bosons to tau pairs, including the cases where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a b-quark jet (MSSM search) or two forward jets from vector boson fusion Higgs boson production (SM search), or where the tau pair has large transverse momentum (SM search). No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. The resulting upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, yield stringent new bounds in the MSSM parameter space, excluding values of tanβ as low as 7.8 at a m_A=160 GeV. In the SM case, the data exclude at 95 boson with a production cross section between 2.8 and 6.3 times that in the standard model.
A combination of measurements of Higgs boson production and decay using up to 139 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at √(s)= 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS experiment. A combination of measurements of Higgs boson production cross sections and branching fractions is presented. The combination is based on the analyses of the Higgs boson decay modes H →γγ, ZZ^∗, WW^∗, ττ, bb̅, μμ, and searches for decays into invisible final states. Up to 139 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data collected at √(s)= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector are used. Combined cross section measurements are presented for the gluon–gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes, and for associated production with vector bosons or top-quarks. The global signal strength, deï¬ned as the measured Higgs boson signal yield normalized to its SM prediction, is determined to be μ = 1.06± 0.07. The combined measurement yields an observed (expected) significance for the associated production with a W boson of 6.3 σ (5.2 σ). Measurements in kinematic regions defined within the simplified template cross section framework are also shown. The results are interpreted in terms of modifiers applied to the Standard Model couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles, and are used to set exclusion limits on parameters in two-Higgs-doublet models. No significant deviations from Standard Model predictions are observed.
Search for additional neutral Higgs bosons decaying to a pair of tau leptons in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. A search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying to tau pairs, beyond the recently discovered boson of mass 125 GeV, is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 24.6 fb^-1, with 4.9 fb^-1 recorded at 7 TeV and 19.7 fb^-1 recorded at 8 TeV center-of-mass energy. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM). The sensitivity of the analysis is enhanced by performing the search in event categories based on the multiplicity of b-tagged jets and on the transverse momentum of hadronic taus. Hadronic tau decays are identified using a multivariate approach. No evidence for a signal is observed. Exclusion limits in the MSSM parameter space are computed for different MSSM benchmark scenarios: m_h^max, m_h^mod+, m_h^mod-, light-stop, light-stau and τ-phobic. Model independent upper limits on cross section times branching fraction for the neutral Higgs boson production of via gluon fusion and in association with bottom quarks are also given.
Decay mode independent search for a light Higgs boson and new scalars.
Observation and measurement of Higgs boson decays to WW^∗ with ATLAS at the LHC. We report the observation of the production of the Higgs boson in its decay to WW^∗, based on an excess over background in the dilepton final state of 6.1 standard deviations, where the standard model expectation is 5.8 standard deviations. Evidence for the vector-boson fusion (VBF) production process is obtained with a significance of 3.2 standard deviations. The results are obtained from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25 pb^-1 from √(s)=7 and 8 TeV pp collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. For a Higgs-boson mass of 125.36 GeV, the ratio of the observed to expected values of the total production cross section times branching fraction is 1.08^+0.16_-0.15 (stat.)^+0.16_-0.13 (syst.). The corresponding ratios for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion production mechanisms are 1.01± 0.19 (stat.)^+0.20_-0.17 (syst.) and 1.28^+0.44_-0.40 (stat.)^+0.29_-0.21 (syst.), respectively. At √(s)=8 TeV the total production cross sections are measured to be σ(gg→ H→ WW^∗) = 4.6±0.9 (stat.) ^+0.8_-0.7 (syst.)pb and σ(VBF H→ WW^∗) = 0.51 ^+0.17_-0.15 (stat.) ^+0.13_-0.08 (syst.)pb. The fiducial cross section is determined for the gluon-gluon fusion process in exclusive final states with zero or one associated jet.
Search for resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bbτ^+τ^- final state using 2016 data. A search for resonant Higgs boson pair production in proton-proton collisions in the bbτ^+τ^- final state is presented. The existence of a new heavy scalar boson H, which decays into a pair of the known h boson, is assumed. The search for pp→H→hh→bbτ^+τ^- is performed using three ττ final states, eτ_h, μτ_h, and τ_hτ_h, where τ_h indicates a τ lepton decay involving hadrons. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb^-1.
Constraints on anomalous HVV couplings in the production of Higgs bosons decaying to tau lepton pairs. A study of anomalous HVV interactions of the Higgs boson and its CP properties is presented. The study uses Higgs boson candidates produced in vector boson fusion, WH and ZH processes and subsequently decaying to a pair of tau leptons. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. A matrix element technique is employed for optimal analysis of four types of anomalous interactions. Constraints are further improved by combination of the H→ττ and H→ 4ℓ decay channels resulting in the most stringent constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to date: f_a3cos(ϕ_a3)=(0.00±0.27)×10^-3, f_a2cos(ϕ_a2)=(0.08^+1.04_-0.21)×10^-3, f_Λ1cos(ϕ_Λ1)=(0.00^+0.53_-0.09)×10^-3, and f_Λ1^Zγcos(ϕ_Λ1^Zγ)=(0.0^+1.1_-1.3)×10^-3. These results are consistent with expectations of the standard model.

Searches for invisible Higgs boson decays with the CMS detector.. Searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson are presented. The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.1, 19.7, and 2.3 fb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, respectively. The search channels target Higgs boson production via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and in association with a vector boson. Upper limits are placed on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay to invisible particles, as a function of the assumed production cross sections. The combination of all channels, assuming standard model production cross sections, yields an observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible branching fraction of 0.24 (0.23) at a 95
Search for top-Higgs resonances in all-hadronic final states using jet substructure methods. This note presents a search for heavy resonances decaying to top quarks and Higgs bosons in all-hadronic final states. The benchmark model is pair-produced vector-like T quarks with charge 2/3. High masses of the T quarks are assumed so that the decay products are highly Lorentz-boosted, such that jets can overlap and get merged. Dedicated methods such as top-tagging and Higgs-tagging algorithms are applied to resolve the substructure of boosted jets. Upper limits on the production cross section of a T quark with masses between 500 GeV/c^2 and 1000 GeV/c^2 are derived. If the heavy T quark has an exclusive branching ratio BR(T→ tH) = 100 lower limit on the mass of the T is 747 GeV/c^2(701 GeV/c^2) after analysing 19.7 fb^-1of integrated luminosity of proton-proton collision data collected at√(s) = 8TeV with the CMS detector.
Search for a Standard Model Higgs boson produced in the decay channel 4l. A search for a Higgs boson in the decay channel H→ ZZ^(*) with each Z boson decaying to an electron or muon pair is presented using pp collisions from the LHC at √(s) = 7 TeV. The data analyzed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.66 ± 0.07 recorded by the CMS detector in 2010 and 2011. The search covers Higgs boson mass (m_ H) hypotheses of 110 < m_ H < 600 with an expected sensitivity varying between one and five times the standard model cross section at 95 while 2.8± 0.2 background events are expected. The events are not clustered in mass excluding interpretation as the standard model Higgs boson. The distribution of events is consistent with the expectation of standard model continuum production of ZZ^(*) pairs and the production cross section for 60 < m_ Z < 120 is measured to be in agreement with the predicted value. Upper limits at 95
Search for Higgs bosons in Two-Higgs-Doublet models in the H → WW→ e νμν channel with the ATLAS detector. The Higgs-like boson observed at the LHC with a mass of approximately 125 GeV could be part of an extended scalar sector originating from two complex Higgs doublets. The analysis presented in this note investigates the possibility of a Two-Higgs-Doublet model (2HDM) being realized in nature by searching for evidence of a second, heavier, CP-even scalar boson in the H→ WW^(*)→ e^-ν̅ μ^+ν / e^+ν μ^-ν̅ decay mode. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 13.0fb^-1. Artificial neural network techniques are used to maximise the sensitivity. No evidence for a second scalar boson is found in the investigated mass range between 135 and 300 GeV. Exclusion limits on type-I and type-II 2HDMs are set as a function of the two mixing angles α and β as well as the mass m_H of the heavier scalar boson. For the limits the signal hypothesis includes the Higgs-like boson at 125 GeV and assumes that it is the light scalar h of a 2HDM, while the null hypothesis assumes no Higgs boson at all.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production cross section via Vector Boson Fusion and associated WH production in the WW^∗→ℓνℓν decay mode with the ATLAS detector at √(s) = 13 TeV. Measurements of the Higgs boson production cross section via Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) and associated WH production using H → WW^∗→ℓνℓν decays are presented. The analyses use events produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5.8 fb^-1 recorded at √(s) = 13 TeV. The total production cross sections are measured to be σ_VBF·ℬ_H → WW^∗ = 1.4^+0.9_-0.7 pb and σ_WH·ℬ_H → WW^∗ = 0.9 ^+1.3_-1.2 pb. The ratios of the measured value to the expected value of the total production cross section times branching fraction for VBF and WH production, μ_ VBF and μ_WH, correspond to μ_ VBF = 1.7^+1.1_-0.9 and μ_WH = 3.2 ^+4.4_-4.2, assuming a Higgs boson mass of m_H = 125 GeV. Since the measurements are statistically limited, 95
Search for MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to μ^+μ^- in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is performed for neutral non-standard-model Higgs bosons decaying to two muons in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV were used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search is sensitive to neutral Higgs bosons produced via the gluon fusion process or in association with a bb̅ quark pair. No significant deviations from the standard model expectation are observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set in the context of the m_h^mod+ and phenomenological MSSM scenarios on the parameter tanβ as a function of the mass of the pseudoscalar A boson, in the range from 130 to 600 GeV. The results are also used to set a model-independent limit on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into a muon pair and the cross section for the production of a scalar neutral boson, either via gluon fusion, or in association with b quarks, in the mass range from 130 to 1000 GeV.
Observation of the Higgs boson decay to a pair of τ leptons with the CMS detector. A measurement of the HâÏÏ signal strength is performed using events recorded in protonâproton collisions by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13TeV . The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fbâ1 . The HâÏÏ signal is established with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations. The best fit of the product of the observed HâÏÏ signal production cross section and branching fraction is 1.09â0.26+0.27 times the standard model expectation. The combination with the corresponding measurement performed with data collected by the CMS experiment at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8TeV leads to an observed significance of 5.9 standard deviations, equal to the expected significance. This is the first observation of Higgs boson decays to Ï leptons by a single experiment.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson and decaying into a tau pair in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson with the decay H→ττ is presented. The data correspond to 20.3 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity from proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during 2012. The data agree with the background expectation, and 95% confidence-level upper limits are placed on the cross section of this process. The observed (expected) limit, expressed in terms of the signal strength μ = σ/σ_SM for m_H = 125 GeV, is μ < 5.6 (3.7). The measured value of the signal strength is μ = 2.3±1.6.
Cross-section measurements of the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of tau leptons in proton–proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A measurement of total production cross sections of the Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions is presented in the H→ττ decay channel. The analysis is performed using 36.1 fb^-1 of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV. All combinations of leptonic (τ→ℓνν̅ with ℓ = e, μ) and hadronic (τ→hadrons ν) tau decays are considered. The H→ττ signal over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is established with an observed (expected) significance of 4.4 (4.1) standard deviations. Combined with results using data taken at 7 and 8 TeV centre-of-mass energies, the observed (expected) significance amounts to 6.4 (5.4) standard deviations and constitutes an observation of H→ττ decays by the ATLAS experiment. Using the data taken at √(s)=13 TeV, the total cross section in the H→ττ decay channel is measured to be 3.71± 0.59 (stat.) ^+0.87_-0.74 (syst.) pb, for a Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV. Total cross sections in the H→ττ decay channel are measured separately for vector boson fusion production and gluon–gluon fusion production to be 0.28 ± 0.09 (stat.) ^+0.11_-0.09 (syst.) pb and 3.0 ± 1.0 (stat.) ^+1.6_-1.2 (syst.) pb, respectively. All measurements are in agreement with Standard Model expectations.
Search for exotic Higgs-boson decays in events with at least one photon, missing transverse momentum, and two forward jets produced in √(s) = 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search is performed for Higgs-boson decays to neutralinos and/or gravitinos in events with at least one photon, missing transverse momentum and two forward jets, a topology where vector boson fusion production is enhanced. The analysis is based on a dataset of proton-proton collision data taken at √(s) = 8 TeV delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded with the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1. The observation is consistent with Standard Model expectation and upper limits are set on the production cross section times branching fraction of the Higgs-boson to decay to neutralinos and/or gravitinos.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson in the decay channel H → ZZ → 4 l in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. A search for a Higgs boson in the four-lepton decay channel H to ZZ, with each Z boson decaying to an electron or muon pair, is reported. The search covers Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range 110 < mH < 600 GeV. The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 inverse femtobarns recorded by the CMS detector in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV from the LHC. Seventy-two events are observed with four-lepton invariant mass m[4 leptons] > 100 GeV (with thirteen below 160 GeV), while 67.1 +/- 6.0 (9.5 +/-1.3) events are expected from background. The four-lepton mass distribution is consistent with the expectation of standard model background production of ZZ pairs. Upper limits at 95% confidence level exclude the standard model Higgs boson in the ranges 134-158 GeV, 180-305 GeV, and 340 -465 GeV. Small excesses of events are observed around masses of 119, 126, and 320 GeV, making the observed limits weaker than expected in the absence of a signal.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson and decaying to a b-quark pair using up to 4.7 fbâ1 of pp collision data at âs = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This paper presents the results of an ATLAS direct search for a Standard Model Higgs boson of mass 110 < mH < 130 GeV produced in association with a W or Z boson and decaying to bb Ì. Three decay channels were considered: ZH â l+lâbb Ì , WH â lÎ½bb Ì and ZH â Î½Î½ Ìbb Ì , where l corresponds to an electron or a muon. No evidence for Higgs boson production is observed in a dataset of 7 TeV pp collisions corresponding to 4.7 fbâ1 of integrated luminosity from the LHC in 2011. Upper limits on Higgs boson production, at the 95% confidence level, of 2.7 to 5.3 times the Standard Model cross section were obtained in the mass range between 110 and 130 GeV. The expected exclusion limits range between 2.6 and 5.1 for the same mass interval.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks and decaying into bb̅ in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a pair of top quarks, tt̅H, is presented. The analysis uses 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 8 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2012. The search is designed for the H to bb̅ decay mode and uses events containing one or two electrons or muons. In order to improve the sensitivity of the search, events are categorised according to their jet and b-tagged jet multiplicities. A neural network is used to discriminate between signal and background events, the latter being dominated by tt̅+jets production. In the single-lepton channel, variables calculated using a matrix element method are included as inputs to the neural network to improve discrimination of the irreducible tt̅+bb̅ background. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found and an observed (expected) limit of 3.4 (2.2) times the Standard Model cross section is obtained at 95% confidence level. The ratio of the measured tt̅H signal cross section to the Standard Model expectation is found to be μ = 1.5 ± 1.1 assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks and decaying into a bb̅ pair in pp collisions at √(s) =13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair, tt̅H, is presented. The analysis uses 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The search targets the H → bb̅ decay mode. Events are selected to contain either one or two electrons or muons from the top-quark decays, and are then categorised according to the number of jets and how likely these are to contain b-hadrons. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate between signal and background events, the latter being dominated by tt̅ + jets production. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, the ratio of the measured tt̅H signal cross-section to the Standard Model expectation is found to be μ = 0.84^+0.64_-0.61. A value of μ higher than 2.0 is excluded at the 95% confidence level, the expected exclusion limit in the absence of signal being 1.2.
Search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel with 4.9/fb of ATLAS data at sqrt(s)= 7 TeV. A search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson using diphoton events produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrts = 7 TeV is performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9/fb collected by the ATLAS experiment. A specific benchmark model is considered where all the fermion couplings to the Higgs boson are set to zero and the bosonic couplings are kept at the Standard Model values. The largest excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is found at masses close to 125.5 GeV, with a significance of 1.6 standard deviations when taking the look elsewhere effect into account. Limits are set using a modified frequentist method (CLs). The data exclude this benchmark model in the ranges 110 - 118 GeV and 119.5 - 121 at 95% CL. The expected exclusion limits are in the range 110 - 123.5 GeV at 95% CL.
Evidence for Higgs boson decay to a pair of muons. Evidence for Higgs boson decay to a pair of muons is presented. This result combines searches in four exclusive categories targeting the production of the Higgs boson via gluon fusion, via vector boson fusion, in association with a vector boson, and in association with a top quark-antiquark pair. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1 , recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. An excess of events over the background expectation is observed in data with a significance of 3.0 standard deviations, where the expectation for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson with mass of 125.38 GeV is 2.5. The combination of this result with that from data recorded at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 fb^-1, respectively, increases both the expected and observed significances by 1%. The measured signal strength, relative to the SM prediction, is 1.19^+0.40_-0.39 (stat)^+0.15_-0.14 (syst). This result constitutes the first evidence for the decay of the Higgs boson to second generation fermions and is the most precise measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to muons reported to date.
Search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two bottom quarks in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This article reports on a search for dark matter pair production in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks, using data from 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The decay of the Higgs boson is reconstructed as a high-momentum bb̅ system with either a pair of small-radius jets, or a single large-radius jet with substructure. The observed data are found to be consistent with the expected Standard Model backgrounds. Model-independent upper limits are placed on the visible cross-sections for events with a Higgs boson decaying into bb̅ and large missing transverse momentum with thresholds ranging from 150 GeV to 400 GeV. Results are interpreted using a simplified model with a Z^' gauge boson decaying into different Higgs bosons predicted in a two-Higgs-doublet model, of which the heavy pseudoscalar Higgs decays into a pair of dark matter particles. Exclusion limits are also presented for the mass scales of various effective field theory operators that describe the interaction between dark matter particles and the Higgs boson.
Observation of a new particle in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb^-1 collected at √(s) = 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H → ZZ^(*)→ llll, H →γγ and H → WW^(*)→ eνμν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H → ZZ^(*), WW^(*), bb̅ and τ^+ τ^- in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H → ZZ^(*)→ llll and H →γγ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0 ± 0.4(stat) ± 0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7x10^-9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.
Higgs to tau tau (MSSM). A search for neutral Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) decaying to tau pairs is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 8 TeV respectively. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 24.6 fb^-1, with 4.9 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes the case where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a b-quark jet. No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. Exclusion limits in the MSSM parameter space of M_A and tanβ in the m_h^ max scenario are presented. Upper limits on the cross section times branching ratio for gluon-fusion and b-associated Higgs production are also given.
Search for Neutral Higgs Bosons Decaying to Tau Pairs in pp Collisions at sqrts=7 TeV. A search for neutral Higgs bosons in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented. The results are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6/fb recorded by the CMS experiment. The search uses decays of the Higgs bosons to tau pairs, including the cases where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a b-quark jet (MSSM search) or two forward jets from vector boson fusion Higgs boson production (SM search). No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. The resulting upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, yield stringent new bounds in the MSSM parameter space.
Measurements of the properties of the Higgs-like boson in the WW^(∗)→ℓνℓν decay channel with the ATLAS detector using 25 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. Evidence for the Higgs-like boson in the H → WW^(∗)→ℓνℓν channel is presented using the complete 2012 and 2011 data samples collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The samples correspond, respectively, to an integrated luminosity of 20.7 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and 4.6 fb^-1 at 7 TeV. The analysis focuses on such a boson in the Standard Model with a mass of m_ H = 125 GeV, where an excess over the expected number of background events is observed. The significance of the excess is 3.8 standard deviations; the expected value is 3.7. The ratio of the observed and expected numbers of events is consistent with unity, μ = 1.01 ± 0.31. The case where the signal is accompanied by two or more jets is optimised for the vector boson fusion production process, and the significance of the excess is 2.5 standard deviations; the expected value is 1.6. The product of the Higgs boson cross section at 8 TeV and the branching ratio to WW^(∗) is measured to be 6.0 ± 1.5 pb; the expected value is 4.8 ± 0.7 pb.
Search for pair production of Higgs bosons in the two tau leptons and two bottom quarks final state using proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for the production of Higgs boson pairs in proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV is presented, making use of a data integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Final states with one Higgs boson decaying into two tau leptons and the other one decaying into two bottom quarks are explored to investigate both the resonant and non-resonant production mechanisms. The observed data are well described by standard model processes and no evidence for a signal contribution is found. For resonant production, upper limits at 95
Search for a massive resonance decaying into a Higgs boson and a W or Z boson in hadronic final states in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. A search for a massive resonance decaying into a standard model Higgs boson (H) and a W or Z boson is reported. The analysis is performed on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Signal events in which the decay products of Higgs, W or Z bosons at high Lorentz boost are contained within a single reconstructed jet are identified using jet substructure techniques, including the tagging of b hadrons. This is the first search for heavy resonances decaying into HW or HZ resulting in an all-jets final state, as well as the first application of jet substructure techniques to identify H→ WW^*→ 4q decays at high Lorentz boost. No significant signal is observed and limits are set at the 95
Search for pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb̅bb̅ final state using proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs-boson pair production in the bb̅bb̅ final state is carried out with 3.2 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The data are consistent with the estimated background and are used to set upper limits on the production cross section of Higgs-boson pairs times branching ratio to bb̅bb̅ for both nonresonant and resonant production. In the case of resonant production of Kaluza–Klein gravitons within the Randall–Sundrum model, upper limits in the 24 to 91 fb range are obtained for masses between 600 and 3000 GeV, at the 95% confidence level. The production cross section times branching ratio for nonresonant Higgs-boson pairs is also constrained to be less than 1.22 pb, at the 95% confidence level.
Search for electroweak neutralino and chargino production in channels with Higgs, Z, and W bosons in pp collisions at 8 TeV . A search for supersymmetry (SUSY) is presented based on the electroweak pair production of neutralinos and charginos, leading to decay channels with Higgs, Z, and W bosons and undetected lightest SUSY particles (LSPs). The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions collected in 2012 by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The main emphasis is neutralino pair production in which each neutralino decays either to a Higgs boson (h) and an LSP or to a Z boson and an LSP, leading to hh, hZ, and ZZ states with missing transverse energy (E_T^miss). A second aspect is chargino-neutralino pair production, leading to hW states with E_T^miss. The decays of a Higgs boson to a bottom-quark pair, to a photon pair, and to final states with leptons are considered in conjunction with hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the Z and W bosons. No evidence is found for supersymmetric interactions, and 95 the respective pair production cross sections and for neutralino and chargino mass values.

The reaction e+e- –> HZ* is used to search for the standard model Higgs boson in the H nu nubar and the H l+ l- channels. The data sample corresponds to about 4.5 million hadronic Z decays collected by the ALEPH experiment at LEP from 1989 to 1995 at centre-of-mass energies at and around the Z peak. Three candidate events are found in the H mu+ mu- channel, in agreement with the expected
Differential cross sections of the Higgs boson measured in the diphoton decay channel using 8 TeV pp collisions. This note presents differential cross section measurements of the Higgs boson, performed in the diphoton decay channel. The dataset used corresponds to 20.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV, produced by the LHC and collected by the ATLAS detector in 2012. With its high signal selection efficiency the diphoton decay channel is well suited to probe the underlying kinematic properties of the signal production and decay. Measurements for several diphoton and jet distributions are made for isolated photons within the geometric acceptance of the detector and they are corrected for experimental acceptance and resolution. Results are compared to theoretical predictions at the particle level.
Search for a light charged Higgs boson decaying to c s̅ in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for a light charged Higgs boson, originating from the decay of a top quark and subsequently decaying into a charm quark and a strange antiquark, is presented. The data used in the analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 recorded in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 8 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in the process t t̅→ W^± b H^∓b̅, where the W boson decays to a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino. The decays lead to a final state comprising an isolated lepton, at least four jets and large missing transverse energy. No significant deviation is observed in the data with respect to the standard model predictions, and model-independent upper limits are set on the branching fraction B ( t → H^+ b ), ranging from 1.2 to 6.5% for a charged Higgs boson with mass between 90 and 160 GeV, under the assumption that B( H^+→ c s̅ ) = 100%.

Search for H to bbar in association with a single top quark as a test of Higgs boson couplings at 13 TeV. A direct search for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark is performed. The analysis considers single top quark production either via the t channel or via the associated production with a W boson and uses Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair and semileptonic top quark decays. Data recorded by the CMS detector in 2015 in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, amounting to an integrated luminosity of about 2.3 fb^-1, are analyzed. Upper limits in the two-dimensional plane spanned by the scaling factors for the coupling strength of the Higgs boson to top quarks and to weak gauge bosons with respect to the standard model predictions, κ_t and κ_V, are determined. The observed (expected) limit on the cross section for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark in the scenario with a negative Yukawa coupling of the top quark (κ_t = -1.0 and κ_V = +1.0) is 6.0 (6.4) times the predicted value. %Additionally, upper limits on a 𝒞𝒫-violating top-Yukawa coupling are estimated.
Measurement of the properties of Higgs boson production at √(s)=13 TeV in the H→γγ channel using 139 fb^â1 of pp collision data with the ATLAS experiment. Measurements of Higgs boson production cross sections are carried out in the diphoton decay channel using 139 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment. The total Higgs boson production cross-section in the Higgs boson rapidity range |y_H|<2.5 times its diphoton decay branching ratio is measured to be 127 ± 10 fb. Cross-sections for gluon fusion, weak vector boson fusion, associated production with a W or Z boson, and top associated production processes are reported. An upper limit of eight times the Standard Model prediction is set for the associated production of a Higgs boson with a single top quark process. Higgs boson production is further characterized through measurements of the Simplified Template Cross-Sections (STXS). In total, cross-sections of 27 STXS regions are measured. The level of compatibility between the measured STXS cross-sections and their Standard Model predictions is 60
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson at the LEP2 collider near √(s) = 183 GeV. During 1997 the ALEPH experiment at LEP gathered 57 of data at centre-of-mass energies near 183. These data are used to look for possible signals from the production of the Standard Model Higgs boson in the reaction ̋̊. No evidence of a signal is found in the data; seven events are selected, in agreement with the expectation of 7.2 events from background processes. This observation results in an improved lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson: > 87.9 at 95
Search for a standard model like Higgs boson in the H to ZZ to l+l- q qbar decay channel at sqrt(s)=8 TeV. A search for a standard-model-like Higgs boson decaying into two Z bosons with subsequent decay into two leptons and two quarks, H→ ZZ→ℓ^+ℓ^- qq̅ is performed. The analysis uses 19.7 fb^-1 of data collected by the CMS experiment from proton-proton collisions produced in LHC at √(s) = 8 TeV. The search exploits the kinematic information and the flavor tagging of the leading particles of the event in order to isolate hypothetical Higgs boson-like signals in the 230 Ge -0.1em V to 1000 Ge -0.1em V mass range. At high mass the two quarks from the Z-decay merge into a single jet and are analyzed with jet-substructure methods. The sensitivity of the analysis is further improved compared to previous similar searches by a dedicated study of a Vector Boson Fusion signatures. We interpret the data in terms of a standard-model-like Higgs boson as well as an electroweak singlet visible through the interference with the recently discovered 125 Ge -0.1em V boson. No evidence of a signal is found and upper limits are set on the production cross section.
Search for production of a Higgs boson and a single top quark in multilepton final states in proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark is presented, focusing on leptonic signatures provided by the H→WW, H→ττ, and H→ZZ decay modes. Due to strong interference of the two main leading-order diagrams, the production cross section of this process is highly sensitive to the relative sign of the top-Higgs coupling modifier, κ_t, and the coupling modifier of vector bosons to the Higgs, κ_V. The analysis exploits signatures with two same-sign leptons or three leptons in the final state, and uses the 2016 data sample collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate the signal from the dominant backgrounds. The analysis yields a 95
Combination of the searches for Higgs boson production in association with top quarks in the γγ, multilepton, and bb̅ decay channels at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. This preliminary result has been removed because a problem was found in the tt̅H, H→ bb̅ 2-lepton channel.
Search for a CP-odd Higgs boson decaying to Zh in pp collisions at âs = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a heavy, CP-odd Higgs boson, A, decaying into a Z boson and a CP-even Higgs boson, h, with a mass of 125 GeV is performed using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search uses protonâproton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fbâ1. Decays of h bosons to pairs of bottom quarks, where the resulting hadronic jets are resolved or merged in the detector, are both considered. Final states of the Z boson decaying to a pair of charged leptons, Z â e+eâ and Z â Î¼+Î¼â, or into neutrinos, Z â Î½Î½, are considered. No evidence for the production of an A boson in these channels is observed. The data are used to determine 95% confidence level upper limits on the product of production cross sections and branching fractions, Ï(pp â A)Â·BR(A â Zh)Â·BR(h â bb), in the range of [4.0,0.017] pb ([6.9, 0.026] pb) for m A = [220, 2000] GeV assuming exclusively gluon-fusion (b-quark- associated) production. Results are also interpreted in the context of benchmark models for a two-Higgs doublet extension of the Standard Model.
Search for Higgs and Z Boson Decays to ϕ γ with the ATLAS Detector. A search for the decays of the Higgs and Z bosons to a ϕ meson and a photon is performed with a pp collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb^-1 collected at √(s)=13TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. No significant excess of events is observed above the background, and 95% confidence level upper limits on the branching fractions of the Higgs and Z boson decays to ϕ γ of 1.4×10^-3 and 8.3×10^-6, respectively, are obtained.
Measurements of properties of the Higgs boson in the four-lepton final state at √(s)=13 TeV. Properties of the Higgs boson are measured in the H→ Z Z→4ℓ (ℓ= e,μ) decay channel. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.5 fb^-1 recorded in 2017 by the CMS detector at the LHC. The signal-strength modifier μ, defined as the ratio of the observed Higgs boson rate in the H→ Z Z→4ℓ decay channel to the standard model expectation, is measured to be μ=1.10^+0.19_-0.17 at m_H=125.09 GeV, the combined ATLAS and CMS measurement of the Higgs boson mass. The signal-strength modifiers for the main Higgs boson production modes are also constrained. Combination with data recorded in 2016 by the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 is reported. All results are found to be compatible with the standard model predictions.
Fiducial and differential cross sections of Higgs boson production measured in the four-lepton decay channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeVÂ Â with the ATLAS detector. Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections of Higgs boson production in the H → ZZ ^*→ 4ℓ decay channel are presented. The cross sections are determined within a fiducial phase space and corrected for detection efficiency and resolution effects. They are based on 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collision data, produced at √(s)=8 TeV centre-of-mass energy at the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS detector. The differential measurements are performed in bins of transverse momentum and rapidity of the four-lepton system, the invariant mass of the subleading lepton pair and the decay angle of the leading lepton pair with respect to the beam line in the four-lepton rest frame, Â as well as the number of jets and the transverse momentum of the leading jet. The measured cross sections are compared to selected theoretical calculations of the Standard Model expectations. No significant deviation from any of the tested predictions is found.
Search for a low mass CP-odd Higgs boson in e^+e^- collisions with the OPAL detector at LEP2. We have analysed the data collected by OPAL at centre-of-mass energies between 189 and 209 GeV searching for Higgs boson candidates from the process e/sup +/e/sup -/ to h/sup 0/Z/sup 0/ followed by the decay of h/sup 0/ to A/sup 0/A/sup 0/ where A/sup 0/ is the CP-odd Higgs boson. The search is done in the region where the A/sup 0/ mass, m/sub A/, is below the production threshold for bb, and the CP- even Higgs boson mass m/sub h/ is within the range 45-86 GeV/c/sup 2 /. In this kinematic range, the decay of h/sup 0/ to A/sup 0/A/sup 0/ may be dominant and previous Higgs boson searches have very small sensitivities. This search can be interpreted within any model that predicts the existence of at least one scalar and one pseudoscalar Higgs boson. No excess of events is observed above the expected standard model backgrounds. Model-independent limits on the cross- section for the process e/sup +/e/sup -/ to h/sup 0/Z/sup 0/ are derived assuming 100% decays of the h/sup 0/ into A/sup 0/A/sup 0/ and 100% decays of the A/sup 0/A/sup 0/ into each of the following final states: cccc, gggg, tau /sup +/ tau /sup -/ tau /sup +/ tau /sup -/, ccgg, gg tau /sup +/ tau /sup -/ and cc tau /sup +/ tau /sup -/. The results are also interpreted in the CP-conserving no-mixing MSSM scenario, where the region 45 <or= m/sub h/ <or= 85 GeV/c/sup 2/ and 2 <or= m/sub A/ <or= 9.5 GeV/c/sup 2/ is excluded. (39 refs).
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and constraints on its couplings from a combined ATLAS and CMS analysis of the LHC pp collision data at √(s)= 7 and 8 TeV. Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or a Z boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes H → ZZ, WW, γγ, ττ, bb, and μμ. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV and 20 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8 TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.09 ± 0.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the H →ττ decay of 5.4 and 5.5 standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.
Search for Charged Higgs Bosons in the τ+jets Final State in tt Decays with 1.03 fb^-1 of pp Collision Data Recorded at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS Experiment. This note presents the results of a search for charged Higgs bosons, H^±, in 1.03 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded at √(s)=7 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC using the τ+jets channel in tt decays with a hadronically decaying τ lepton in the final state. The data agree with the SM expectation leading to a limit on the product of branching ratios BR(t → bH^±) × BR(H^±→τν) of 0.03-0.10 for H^± masses in the range 90 <m_H^±<160. In the context of the MSSM values of tanβ larger than 22-30 are excluded in the mass range 90 < m_H^±< 140.
Search for heavy Higgs bosons A/H decaying to a top-quark pair in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a pseudoscalar (A) or scalar (H) heavy Higgs boson decaying into a top-quark pair (tt̅) has been conducted in 20.3 fb^â1 of data collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=8 TeV. The analysis relies on the invariant mass spectrum of the tt̅ pair in final states with an electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets. Interference effects between the signal process and gg→ tt̅ production in the Standard Model, which heavily distort the signal shape from a single peak to a peak-dip structure, are taken into account. Exclusion limits are derived for two resonance masses (500 and 750 GeV), as a function of the parameter tanÎ² in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models.
Search for doubly and singly charged Higgs bosons decaying into vector bosons in multi-lepton final states with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into W^± W^± or W^± Z bosons is performed, involving experimental signatures with two leptons of the same charge, or three or four leptons with a variety of charge combinations, missing transverse momentum and jets. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider between 2015 and 2018 is used. The data correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. The search is guided by a type-II seesaw model that extends the scalar sector of the Standard Model with a scalar triplet, leading to a phenomenology that includes doubly and singly charged Higgs bosons. Two scenarios are explored, corresponding to the pair production of doubly charged H^±± bosons, or the associated production of a doubly charged H^±± boson and a singly charged H^± boson. No significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed. H^±± bosons are excluded at 95% confidence level up to 350 GeV and 230 GeV for the pair and associated production modes, respectively.
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to a pair of tau leptons in pp collisions. A search for neutral Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) decaying to tau-lepton pairs in pp collisions is performed, using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 24.6 fb^-1, with 4.9 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes the case where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a b-quark jet. No excess is observed in the tau-lepton-pair invariant mass spectrum. Exclusion limits are presented in the MSSM parameter space for different benchmark scenarios, m_h^max, m_h^mod+, m_h^mod-, light-stop, light-stau, τ-phobic, and low-m_H. Upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction for gluon fusion and b-quark associated Higgs boson production are also given.
Search for the neutral Higgs boson.
Search for a Higgs boson in the decay channel H → ZZ^(*)→ qq̅l^-l^+ in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying into two Z bosons with subsequent decay into a final state containing two quark jets and two leptons, H → ZZ^(*)→ qq̅l^-l^+ is presented. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. In order to discriminate between signal and background events, kinematic and topological quantities, including the angular spin correlations of the decay products, are employed. Events are further classified according to the probability of the jets to originate from quarks of light or heavy flavor or from gluons. No evidence for the Higgs boson is found, and upper limits on its production cross section are determined for a Higgs boson of mass between 130 and 600 GeV.
Measurement of the transverse momentum spectrum of the Higgs boson produced in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV using H → W W decays. The cross section for Higgs boson production in pp collisions is studied using the H → W ^+ W ^- decay mode, followed by leptonic decays of the W bosons to an oppositely charged electron-muon pair in the final state. The measurements are performed using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 fb^-1. The Higgs boson transverse momentum (p_T) is reconstructed using the lepton pair p_T and missing p_T. The differential cross section times branching fraction is measured as a function of the Higgs boson p_T in a fiducial phase space defined to match the experimental acceptance in terms of the lepton kinematics and event topology. The production cross section times branching fraction in the fiducial phase space is measured to be 39 ± 8 (stat) ± 9 (syst) fb. The measurements are found to agree, within experimental uncertainties, with theoretical calculations based on the standard model.
Constraints on New Phenomena via Higgs Coupling Measurements with the ATLAS Detector. The ATLAS experiment at the LHC has determined the couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles, as well as its mass, using the combination of measurements from multiple production and decay channels with up to 4.8 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s)=7 TeV and 20.3 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV. In this study, the mass dependence of the couplings is probed and the coupling measurements are interpreted in different extensions of the Standard Model. An indirect search is performed for a composite Higgs boson, an additional electroweak singlet, an additional electroweak doublet (two-Higgs-doublet model), a simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and a Higgs portal to dark matter. The measured production and decay rates of the observed Higgs boson in the h→γγ, h→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ, h→ WW^*→ℓνℓν, h→ττ, and h→ bb̅ channels, the measured mass in the h→γγ and h→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ decay modes, and the measured upper limit on the rate of the Zh →ℓℓ + E_T^miss process are used to constrain parameters of these models.
Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the H→γγ decay channel are reported. The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV during the 2016 LHC running period, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.6 fb^-1. Allowing the Higgs mass to float, the measurement yields a signal strength relative to the standard model prediction of 1.18^+0.17_-0.14=1.18^+0.12_-0.11 (stat) ^+0.09_-0.07 (syst) ^+0.07_-0.06 (theo), which is largely insensitive to the exact Higgs mass around 125 GeV. Signal strengths associated with the different Higgs boson production mechanisms, couplings to bosons and fermions, and effective couplings to photons and gluons are also measured.
Search for Charged Higgs Bosons at LEP in General Two Higgs Doublet Models. A search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons was performed in the data collected by the DELPHI detector at LEP II at centre-of-mass energies from 189 GeV to 209 GeV. Five different final states, tau+ nu_tau tau- anti-nu_tau, c sbar cbar s, c sbar tau- anti-nu_tau, W* A W* A and W* A tau- anti-nu_tau were considered, accounting for the major expected decays in type I and type II Two Higgs Doublet Models. No significant excess of data compared to the expected Standard Model processes was observed. The existence of a charged Higgs boson with mass lower than 76.7 GeV/c^2 (type I) or 74.4 GeV/c^2 (type II) is excluded at the 95% confidence level, for a wide range of the model parameters. Model independent cross-section limits have also been calculated.
Lower bound for the standard model Higgs boson mass from combining the results of the four LEP experiments.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying via H^±→τ^±ν_τ in the τ+jets and τ+lepton final states with 36 fb^-1 of pp collision data recorded at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment. Charged Higgs bosons produced either in top-quark decays or in association with a top-quark, subsequently decaying via H^Â± â Ï^Â±Î½_Ï, are searched for in 36.1 fb^â1 of proton-proton collision data at √(s)=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. Depending on whether the top-quark produced together with H^Â± decays hadronically or leptonically, the search targets Ï+jets and Ï+lepton final states, in both cases with a hadronically decaying Ï-lepton. No evidence of a charged Higgs boson is found. For the mass range of m_H^± = 90â2000 GeV, upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross-section of the charged Higgs boson times the branching fraction ℬ(H^±→τ^±ν_τ) in the range 4.2â0.0025 pb. In the mass range 90â160 GeV, assuming the Standard Model cross-section for tt production, this corresponds to upper limits between 0.25% and 0.031% for the branching fraction ℬ(t→ bH^±)×ℬ(H^±→τ^±ν_τ) .
Search for resonances decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons in the bb̅qq̅'ℓν final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for new massive particles decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented. The result uses data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search is performed for resonances in the mass range between 0.8 and 3.5 TeV for events in which one Higgs boson decays into a bottom quark pair (bb̅) and the other decays into two W bosons that subsequently decay into a lepton, a neutrino, and a quark pair (qq̅'). The former Higgs boson is reconstructed as a single jet with substructure consistent with a bb̅ decay, and the latter as an isolated lepton and a nearby jet of merged W→qq̅' decay products. The two-dimensional distribution of the bb̅ jet mass versus the candidate resonance mass is used in a maximum likelihood fit to separate signal from background. The data are consistent with standard model expectations. Exclusion limits are placed on the product of cross section and branching fraction for spin-0 radions and spin-2 bulk gravitons in models with a warped extra spatial dimension.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with W or Z bosons, and decaying to bottom quarks for HCP 2012. A search for the standard model Higgs boson (H) decaying to bb̅ when produced in association with a weak vector boson (V) is reported for the following modes: W(μν)H, W(eν)H, Z(μμ)H, Z(ee)H and Z(νν)H. The search is performed in data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.0 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV and 12.1 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Upper limits, at the 95
Search for a Higgs Boson Decaying to Weak Boson Pairs at LEP. A Higgs particle produced in association with a Z boson and decaying into weak boson pairs is searched for in 336.4 1/pb of data collected by the L3 experiment at LEP at centre-of-mass energies from 200 to 209 GeV. Limits on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay into two weak bosons as a function of the Higgs mass are derived. These results are combined with the L3 search for a Higgs boson decaying to photon pairs. A Higgs produced with a Standard Model e+e- –> Zh cross section and decaying only into electroweak boson pairs is excluded at 95% CL for a mass below 107 GeV.
Search for the associated production of the Higgs boson and a vector boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV via Higgs boson decays to τ leptons. A search for the standard model Higgs boson, decaying to a pair of τ leptons and produced in association with a W or a Z boson is performed. A data sample of proton-proton collisions collected at √(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The signal strength is measured relative to the expectation for the standard model Higgs boson, yielding μ = 2.5^+1.4 _-1.3. These results are combined with earlier CMS measurements targeting Higgs boson decays to a pair of τ leptons, performed with the same data set in the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes. The combined signal strength is μ = 1.24^+0.29 _-0.27 (1.00^+0.24 _-0.23 expected), and the observed significance is 5.5 standard deviations (4.8 expected) for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV.
Search for heavy top-like quarks decaying to a Higgs boson and a top quark in the lepton plus jets final state in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for production of a heavy up-type quark (t^') together with its antiparticle, assuming a significant branching ratio for subsequent t^' decay into a Standard Model Higgs boson and a top quark, as predicted by vector-like quark models. The search is based on 14.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Data are analysed in the lepton+jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron or muon with moderately high transverse momentum, significant missing transverse momentum, and at least six jets. The search exploits the high total transverse momenta of all final state objects and the high multiplicity of b jets characteristic of signal events with at least one Higgs boson decaying into bb̅, to discriminate against the dominant background from top quark pair production. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and upper limits are derived for vector-like quarks of various masses in the two-dimensional plane of BR(t^'→ Wb) versus BR(t^'→ Ht), where H is the Standard Model Higgs boson, assumed to have a mass of 125 GeV. Under the branching ratio assumptions corresponding to a weak-isospin doublet (singlet) scenario, a t^' quark with mass lower than 790 (640) GeV is excluded at the 95
Constraints on anomalous HVV couplings from the production of Higgs bosons decaying to τ lepton pairs. A study is presented of anomalous HVV interactions of the Higgs boson, including its CP properties. The study uses Higgs boson candidates produced mainly in vector boson fusion and gluon fusion that subsequently decay to a pair of τ leptons. The data were recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. A matrix element technique is employed for the analysis of anomalous interactions. The results are combined with those from the H→ 4ℓ decay channel presented earlier, yielding the most stringent constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings to electroweak vector bosons expressed as effective cross-section fractions and phases: the CP-violating parameter f_a3cos(ϕ_a3)=(0.00 ± 0.27 )×10^-3 and the CP-conserving parameters f_a2cos(ϕ_a2)=(0.08^+1.04_-0.21)×10^-3, f_Λ1cos(ϕ_Λ1)=(0.00^+0.53_-0.09)×10^-3, and f_Λ1^Zγcos(ϕ_Λ1^Zγ)=(0.0^+1.1_-1.3)×10^-3. The current data set does not allow for precise constraints on CP properties in the gluon fusion process. The results are consistent with standard model expectations.
Search for a Standard Model-like Higgs boson decaying into WW to l nu qqbar in pp collisions at sqrt s = 8 TeV. A search for a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson decaying into the WW final state is performed with an integrated luminosity of up to 19.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV in the high mass regime 600 < m_ H < 1000 GeV. The search is performed in the semi-leptonic channel where the hadronically decaying W boson is highly boosted and its decay products are contained in one jet. Jet substructure techniques are used in identifying the hadronically decaying W. The results are also interpreted in a beyond the Standard Model heavy Higgs scenario, based on an effective theory which predicts the existence of two Higgs-like scalar particles, with the mass of the lighter one being around 125 GeV, that completes the unitarization of the WW scattering.
Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson using vector-boson fusion in pp collisions at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a Higgs boson produced via vector-boson fusion and decaying into invisible particles is presented, using 20.3 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, assuming the Standard Model production cross section, an upper bound of 0.28 is set on the branching fraction of H→ invisible at 95% confidence level, where the expected upper limit is 0.31. The results are interpreted in models of Higgs-portal dark matter where the branching fraction limit is converted into upper bounds on the dark-matter–nucleon scattering cross section as a function of the dark-matter particle mass, and compared to results from the direct dark-matter detection experiments.
Search for the neutral Higgs bosons of the MSSM in e^+ e^- collisions at √(s) from 130 to 172 GeV. The process e+e- –> h A is used to search for the Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), in the bbbb and tautaubb final states. The search is performed in the data collected by the ALEPH experiment at LEP, at centre-of-mass energies between 130 and 172 GeV and with a total luminosity of 27.2 pb-1. No candidate events are found in either of the final states, in agreement with the expected background of 0.91 events from all Standard Model processes. Combined with searches for e+e- –> hZ, this results in a 95% C.L. lower limit on the masses of both h and A of 62.5 GeV/c2, for tan(beta) > 1.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and coupling strengths using pp collision data at √(s)=7 and 8 TeV in the ATLAS experiment. Combined analyses of the Higgs boson production and decay rates as well as its coupling strengths to vector bosons and fermions are presented. The combinations include the results of the analyses of the H→γγ, ZZ^*, WW^*, Zγ, bb̅, ττ and μμ decay modes, and the constraints on the associated production with a pair of top quarks and on the off-shell coupling strengths of the Higgs boson. The results are based on the LHC proton–proton collision datasets, with integrated luminosities of up to 4.7 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV and 20.3 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and 2012. Combining all production modes and decay channels, the measured signal yield, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, is 1.18^+0.15_-0.14. The data provide unequivocal confirmation of the gluon fusion production of the Higgs boson, strong evidence of vector-boson fusion production and support Standard Model assumptions of production in association with vector bosons or a pair of top quarks. The observed Higgs boson production and decay rates are interpreted in a leading-order coupling framework, exploring a wide range of benchmark coupling models both with and without assumptions on the Higgs boson width and on the Standard Model particle content in loop processes. Generic Higgs boson coupling models that allow measurement of coupling strengths to μ, τ leptons, b, t quarks and W, Z bosons, or ratios of these coupling strengths, are presented. The observed data are found to be compatible with the Standard Model expectations for a Higgs boson at a mass of 125.36 GeV for all models considered.
Search for resonant Higgs boson pair production in the bbτ^+τ^- final state. A search for resonant Higgs boson pair production in proton-proton collisions in the bbτ^+τ^- final state is presented. The search assumes the existence of a new heavy scalar boson H, which decays into a pair of the known h bosons. The search for pp→H→hh→bbτ^+τ^- is performed using three ττ final states, eτ_h, μτ_h, and τ_hτ_h, where τ_h indicates a τ lepton decaying into hadrons. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2015 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb^-1.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and constraints on its couplings from a combined ATLAS and CMS analysis of the LHC pp collision data at √(s)= 7 and 8 TeV. Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or a Z boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes H → ZZ, WW, γγ, ττ, bb, and μμ. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV and 20 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8 TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.09 ± 0.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the H →ττ decay of 5.4 and 5.5 standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.
Search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson in e^+e^- collisions at 189 GeV. The data collected in 1998 by ALEPH at LEP at a centre-of-mass energy of 188.6 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 176.2 pb-1, are analysed to search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced in the reaction e+e- -> hZ. The number of events found in the data and their properties are in agreement with the Standard Model expectation. This search results in an improved 95% C.L. lower limit on the Higgs boson mass of 95.4 GeV/c2, assuming it decays totally invisibly and for a production cross section equal to that of the Standard Model.
An update to the combined search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using up to 4.9 fbâ1 of pp collision data at âs = 7 TeV. A preliminary combination of Standard Model Higgs boson searches with the ATLAS experiment, in a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 to 4.9 fbâ1 of pp collision data collected at âs = 7 TeV at the LHC, is presented. A Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded at the 95% confidence level (CL) in the mass ranges from 110.0 GeV to 117.5 GeV, 118.5 GeV to 122.5 GeV, and 129 GeV to 539 GeV, while the range 120 GeV to 555 GeV is expected to be excluded in the absence of a signal. The mass regions be- tween 130 GeV and 486 GeV are excluded at the 99% CL. An excess of events is observed around mHâ¼126 GeV with a local significance of 2.5Ï, where the expected significance in the presence of a Standard Model Higgs boson for that mass hypothesis is 2.9Ï. The global probability for such an excess to occur in the full search mass range 110-600 GeV is approximately 30%, decreasing to 10% when restricted to the range 110-146 GeV.
Inclusive search for a highly boosted Higgs boson decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair at √(s) = 13 TeV with 137 fb^-1. An inclusive search for the standard model Higgs boson produced with large transverse momentum (p_T) and decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair is performed using pp collisions data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at √(s)=13 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. Highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs bosons decaying to bb are reconstructed as single, large radius jets, and are identified using jet substructure and dedicated b tagging techniques based on a deep neural network. The method is validated with Z→bb decays. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events above the expected background is observed with a local significance of 2.54 standard deviations, where the expectation is 0.71. The corresponding signal strength is μ_H = 3.68 ± 1.20(stat)_-0.66^+0.63(syst)_-0.46^+0.81(theo) with respect to the standard model expectation. Additionally, an unfolded differential cross section as a function of Higgs boson p_T is presented. With respect to the previous CMS result, the relative precision of the Higgs boson signal strength measurement improves by approximately a factor of two. The improvement is due to the increased integrated luminosity, improved b tagging, and smaller theoretical uncertainties.
Searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s)= 7, 8, and 13 TeV. Searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson are presented. The data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.1, 19.7, and 2.3 fb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, respectively. The search channels target Higgs boson production via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and in association with a vector boson. Upper limits are placed on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson decay to invisible particles, as a function of the assumed production cross sections. The combination of all channels, assuming standard model production, yields an observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible branching fraction of 0.24 (0.23) at the 95% confidence level. The results are also interpreted in the context of Higgs-portal dark matter models.
Search for new light gauge bosons in Higgs boson decays to four-lepton final states in pp collisions at √(s)=8TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This paper presents a search for Higgs bosons decaying to four leptons, either electrons or muons, via one or two light exotic gauge bosons Z_d, H→ Z Z_d → 4ℓ or H→ Z_d Z_d → 4ℓ. The search was performed using pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 20 fb^-1 at the center-of-mass energy of √(s)=8TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The observed data are well described by the Standard Model prediction. Upper bounds on the branching ratio of H→ Z Z_d → 4ℓ and on the kinetic mixing parameter between the Z_d and the Standard Model hypercharge gauge boson are set in the range (1–9)×10^-5 and (4–17)×10^-2 respectively, at 95% confidence level assuming the Standard Model branching ratio of H→ Z Z^* → 4ℓ, for Z_d masses between 15 and 55 GeV. Upper bounds on the effective mass mixing parameter between the Z and the Z_d are also set using the branching ratio limits in the H → ZZ_d→ 4ℓ search, and are in the range (1.5–8.7)× 10^-4 for 15<m_Z_d < 35 GeV. Upper bounds on the branching ratio of H→ Z_dZ_d → 4ℓ and on Higgs portal coupling parameter, controlling the strength of the coupling of the Higgs boson to dark vector bosons, are set in the range (2–3)×10^-5 and (1–10)× 10^-4 respectively, at 95 % confidence level assuming the Standard Model Higgs boson production cross sections, for Z_d masses between 15 and 60 GeV.
Constraints on Anomalous HWW Interactions using Higgs boson decays to W+W- in the fully leptonic final state. Studies on anomalous Higgs boson interactions with pairs of W gauge bosons, as well as its spin parity are presented. The analysis is performed in the Higgs boson decay channel to W^+W^- with two charged leptons, one electron and one muon, and two neutrinos in the final state. The analysis is based on data recorded with the CMS detector in pp collisions at a center of mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC. The tensor structure of interactions under the spin-0 hypothesis is examined and alternative spin-parity hypotheses are studied to cover the spin-1 and spin-2 models. The hypothesis of the standard model Higgs boson for quantum numbers and couplings is consistent with the data and the results are expressed as exclusion bounds of several spin-parity hypotheses and anomalous coupling parameters.
Search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. Combined results are reported from searches for a fermiophobic Higgs boson in the γγ, WW, and ZZ decay modes in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. The explored Higgs boson mass range is 110-300 GeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9-5.1 inverse femtobarns. A fermiophobic Higgs boson is excluded at 95% confidence level in the mass range 110-194 GeV, and at 99% confidence level in the mass ranges 110-124.5 GeV, 127-147.5 GeV, and 155-180 GeV.
Search for H →γγ produced in association with top quarks and constraints on the Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson using data taken at 7 TeV and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is performed for Higgs bosons produced in association with top quarks using the diphoton decay mode of the Higgs boson. Selection requirements are optimized separately for leptonic and fully hadronic final states from the top quark decays. The dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.5 of proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 20.3 at 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess over the background prediction is observed and upper limits are set on the tt̅H production cross section. The observed exclusion upper limit at 95% confidence level is 6.7 times the predicted Standard Model cross section value. In addition, limits are set on the strength of the Yukawa coupling between the top quark and the Higgs boson, taking into account the dependence of the tt̅H and tH cross sections as well as the H →γγ branching fraction on the Yukawa coupling. Lower and upper limits at 95% confidence level are set at -1.3 and +8.0 times the Yukawa coupling strength in the Standard Model.
Higgs Candidates in e^+ e^- Interactions at √(s)= 206.6 GeV. In a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson, carried out on 212.5 pb^-1 of data collected by the L3 detector at the highest LEP centre-of-mass energies, including 116.5 pb^-1 above √(s) = 206 GeV, an excess of candidates for the process e^+ e^- → Z^*→ HZ is found for Higgs masses near 114.5 GeV. We present an analysis of our data and the characteristics of our strongest candidates.
Search for the decay of a Higgs boson in the ℓℓγ channel in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into a pair of electrons or muons and a photon is described. Higgs boson decays to a Z boson and a photon (H→Zγ→ℓℓγ, ℓ=e or μ), or to two photons, one of which has an internal conversion into a muon pair (H→γ^*γ→μμγ) were considered. The analysis is performed using a data set recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. No significant excess above the background prediction has been found. Limits are set on the cross section for a standard model Higgs boson decaying to opposite-sign electron or muon pairs and a photon. The observed limits on cross section times the corresponding branching fractions vary between 1.4 and 4.0 (6.1 and 11.4) times the standard model cross section for H→γ^*γ→μμγ (H→Zγ→ℓℓγ) in the 120-130 GeV mass range of the ℓℓγ system. The H→γ^*γ→μμγ and H→Zγ→ℓℓγ analyses are combined for m_H = 125 GeV, obtaining an observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit of 3.9 (2.0) times the standard model cross section.
Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced via vector boson fusion at √(s)=13 TeV.. A search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced via vector boson fusion has been performed in the 13 TeV dataset collected by CMS in 2015. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.30 fb^-1. A dedicated trigger is used to select events with a jet pair compatible with vector boson fusion production of a Higgs boson, together with missing energy from its invisible decay. The offline selection makes further use of the event topology. Backgrounds arise from Z(νν)+jets and W(lν)+jets in which the charged lepton is unidentified, and QCD multijet production. Signal and background yields are extracted from a simultaneous fit to the signal region and multiple control regions. Minor backgrounds from diboson and top-quark processes are estimated from Monte-Carlo simulation. The observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible branching fraction of the 125 GeV Higgs boson is found to be 69
Combination of Higgs Searches. The overall combination is presented of eight standard model (SM) Higgs boson searches performed by the CMS Collaboration using the following Higgs boson decay signatures: H →γγ, H →ττ, H → bb, H → WW → 2ℓ 2ν, H → ZZ → 4ℓ, H → ZZ → 2ℓ 2 τ, H → ZZ → 2ℓ 2ν, and H → ZZ → 2ℓ 2q. Depending on the analysis, the amount of data used corresponds to 1.1-1.7 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity. The SM Higgs boson is excluded at 95 The largest excursion of the observed data from the expected has a probability of 0.4 after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect. At 90 The reported limits were obtained using the modified frequentist construction known as the CL_s method.
Search for chargino and neutralino production in final states with one lepton, two b-jets consistent with a Higgs boson, and missing transverse momentum with the ATLAS detector in 20.3 fb^-1 of √(s) = 8 TeV pp collisions. A search for direct production of charginos (χ^±_1) and neutralinos (χ^0_2) in final states with one charged lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum, and two jets identified as originating from b-quarks and consistent with a 125 GeV Higgs boson is performed. The analysis uses 20.3 fb^-1 of protonâproton collision data at √(s) = 8 TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess is observed with respect to the expectations from Standard Model processes. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric models considering pp -> χ^±_1χ^0_2 production followed by χ^±_1 -> W^± ( -> ℓν) χ^0_1 and χ^0_2 -> h (->bb̅) χ^0_1, where χ^0_1 is the lightest neutralino and supersymmetric particle and m_χ^±_1 = m_χ^0_2 is assumed. For a massless χ^0_1, mass ranges of 125 < m_χ^±_1,χ^0_2 < 141 GeV and 166 < m_χ^±_1,χ^0_2 < 287 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, determined at -1σ signal theoretical uncertainty, for an expected exclusion range of 225 < m_χ^±_1,χ^0_2 < 235 GeV.
Search for production of Higgs boson pairs in the four b quark final state using large-area jets in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search is presented for pair production of the standard model Higgs boson using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The final state consists of two b quark-antiquark pairs. The search is conducted in the region of phase space where one pair is highly Lorentz-boosted and is reconstructed as a single large-area jet, and the other pair is resolved and is reconstructed using two b-tagged jets. The results are obtained by combining this analysis with another from CMS looking for events with two large jets. Limits are set on the product of the cross sections and branching fractions for narrow bulk gravitons and radions in warped extra-dimensional models having a mass in the range 750-3000 GeV. The resulting observed and expected upper limits on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross section correspond to 179 and 114 times the standard model value, respectively, at 95% confidence level. The existence of anomalous Higgs boson couplings is also investigated and limits are set on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross sections for representative coupling values.
Search for associated production of Higgs bosons and top quarks in multilepton final states at √(s)=13 TeV. We present a search for the associated production of a standard model Higgs boson and a top quark-anti quark pair (ttH), using LHC pp collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a center of mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV in 2016. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb^-1. The analysis uses events with two leptons of the same charge or at least three charged leptons, produced together with b jets, targeting Higgs boson decay modes to WW^*, ZZ^*, and ττ and leptonic decays of at least one of the top quarks. The results are combined with the 2015 dataset and yield a ttH signal strength of 2.0 ^+0.8_-0.7 times the standard model prediction. They are used to set a 95
Search for heavy resonances that decay into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in hadronic final states at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for heavy resonances with masses above 1 TeV , decaying to final states containing a vector boson and a Higgs boson, is presented. The search considers hadronic decays of the vector boson, and Higgs boson decays to b quarks. The decay products are highly boosted, and each collimated pair of quarks is reconstructed as a single, massive jet. The analysis is performed using a data sample collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 . The data are consistent with the background expectation and are used to place limits on the parameters of a theoretical model with a heavy vector triplet. In the benchmark scenario with mass-degenerate W^' and Z' bosons decaying predominantly to pairs of standard model bosons, for the first time heavy resonances for masses as high as 3.3 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, setting the most stringent constraints to date on such states decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson.
Search for a non-minimal Higgs boson produced in the reaction e^+e^-→ hZ.
Search for a Standard Model-like Higgs boson decaying into WW to l nu qqbar in exclusive jet bins in pp collisions at sqrt s = 8 TeV. A search for a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into the WW final state is performed with an integrated luminosity of up to 19.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV in the high mass region 600 < m_ H < 1000 GeV. This search is performed in the semi-leptonic channel, where the hadronically decaying W boson is highly boosted and its decay products are contained in one jet. Jet substructure techniques are used in identifying the hadronically decaying W. The analysis is divided into categories of additional jet activity in order to highlight the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production mechanisms improving the sensitivity. No evidence for a standard model-like Higgs boson has been found in the investigated mass region. The results are also interpreted in a beyond the Standard Model Higgs scenario, based on an effective theory which predicts the existence of heavy Higgs singlet, with the mass of the lighter one being around 125 GeV.
Search for Higgs boson decays to a photon and a Z boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is reported for a neutral Higgs boson in the decay channel H â Zγ, Z â l^+ l^- (l = e,Âµ), using 4.5 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV and 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The observed distribution of the invariant mass of the three final-state particles, m_llγ, is consistent with the Standard Model hypothesis in the investigated mass range of 120â150 GeV. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.5 GeV, the observed upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 11 times the Standard Model expectation. Upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio of a neutral Higgs boson with mass in the range 120â150 GeV between 0.13 and 0.5 pb for √(s) = 8 TeV at 95% confidence level.
Search for an Invisibly Decaying Higgs Boson Produced via Vector Boson Fusion in pp Collisions at √(s)=8 TeV using the ATLAS Detector at the LHC. A search for Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion and decaying into invisible particles using 20.3 fb^-1 of data recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV and assuming the Standard Model production cross-section, an upper bound of 0.29 is set on the branching fraction of H→ invisible at 95% confidence level, where the expected upper limit is 0.35.
Search for Neutral Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs Bosons H/A →ττ produced in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. A search for neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) decaying to a pair of τ leptons is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb^-1 from √(s) = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The heavy resonance produced via gluon-fusion or b-associated production is assumed to decay to a τ^+ τ^- pair with at least one τ lepton decaying hadronically. The search is performed in the mass range of 200 GeV - 1.2 TeV. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model and hence results are given in terms of upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of a scalar boson as a function of its mass. The results are interpreted in a range of MSSM scenarios. The most stringent constraints on tanβ for the search excludes tanβ > 10 for m_A = 200 GeV. This analysis improves on the limits of the previous ATLAS analysis, based on data collected at √(s)=8 TeV, for the mass range m_A > 700 GeV.
Search for Higgs boson decays into a Z boson and a light hadronically decaying resonance using 13 TeV pp collision data from the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs boson decays into a Z boson and a light resonance in two-lepton plus jet events is performed, using a pp collision dataset with an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 collected at √(s)=13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN LHC. The resonance considered is a light boson with a mass below 4 GeV from a possible extended scalar sector, or a charmonium state. Multivariate discriminants are used for the event selection and for evaluating the mass of the light resonance. No excess of events above the expected background is found. Observed (expected) 95% confidence-level upper limits are set on the Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to a Z boson and the signal resonance, with values in the range 17 pb to 340 pb (16^+6_-5 pb to 320^+130_-90 pb) for the different light spin-0 boson mass and branching fraction hypotheses, and with values of 110 pb and 100 pb (100^+40_-30 pb and 100^+40_-30 pb) for the η_c and J/ψ hypotheses, respectively.
Search for pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb̅bb̅ final state using proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs-boson pair production in the bb̅bb̅ final state is carried out with 13.3 fb^-1 of LHC proton-proton collision data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. The data are consistent with the estimated background and are used to set upper limits on the production cross section of Higgs-boson pairs times branching ratio to bb̅bb̅ for both non-resonant and resonant production. In the context of the Randall–Sundrum model, upper limits in the 1000 fb to 2 fb range are obtained for masses between 300 and 3000 GeV, at the 95% confidence level. The cross section times branching ratio for non-resonant Standard Model Higgs-boson pair production is constrained to be less than 330 fb, 29 times the Standard Model predicted cross section of 11.3^+0.9_-1.0 fb.
Search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons decaying to tau+tau- pairs in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for neutral Higgs bosons decaying to pairs of tau leptons with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, recorded in 2011 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.06 fb^â1 . After signal selection, 4630 events are observed in this data sample. The observed number of events is consistent with the total expected background of 4900 Â± 600 events. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are derived for the production cross section of a generic Higgs boson phi as a function of the Higgs boson mass and for A/H/h production in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as a function of the parameters mA and tan beta.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into a top and a bottom quark in the all-jet final state of pp collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search for charged Higgs bosons (H^±) decaying into a top and a bottom quark in the all-jet final states is presented. The analysis uses LHC proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 at √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. No significant excess is observed above the expected background. Model-independent upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the H^± production cross section and branching fraction in two scenarios. For production in association with a top quark, limits of 21.3 to 0.007 pb are obtained for H^± masses in the range of 0.2 to 3 TeV. Combining this with data from a search in leptonic final states results in improved limits of 9.25 to 0.005 pb. The complementary s-channel production of an H^± is investigated in the mass range of 0.8 to 3 TeV and the corresponding upper limits are 4.5 to 0.023 pb. These results are interpreted using different minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model.
Inclusive search for doubly charged Higgs in leptonic final states with the 2011 data at 7 TeV. A search for the doubly charged Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s)=7is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The doubly charged Higgs is a member of SU(2)_L scalar triplet Φ in extensions of the Standard Model which include the seesaw mechanism of type II. The search is inclusive and is performed in events with three or more isolated charged leptons of all flavors originating from the decays of pair produced triplet components Φ^++Φ^– and Φ^++Φ^-. No signal is observed and new lower limits at the 95
Search for Charged Higgs boson to cb̅ in lepton+jets channel using top quark pair events. Results on the search for a light charged Higgs boson H^+ decaying to cb̅ in top quark pair events using the CMS detector at the LHC are presented. %It is the first search for a charged Higgs boson in this decay mode. The total dataset corresponds to 19.7 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. In tt̅ decays, if one top quark decays to H^+ b, instead of W b, and the H^+ subsequently decays to c b̅, while other top quark decays leptonically (t̅→ W^-b̅→ l ν̅b̅)), the final state then consists of four jets (three b quark jets), one lepton (electron or muon), and missing energy: tt̅→ (H^+b)(W^-b̅) → (cb̅ b) (l ν̅b̅). The main observable used in the analysis is an invariant mass of two jets, one of which is identified as a b quark jet. The dijet pair is selected from at least four jets in an event by a dedicated kinematic fitter. No signal for the presence of a charged Higgs boson is observed and upper limits are set at 95 from 1.1–0.4
Search for a Standard Model Higgs in the mass range 200-600 GeV in the channel H→ ZZ→ llqq with with the ATLAS detector. A search for a heavy Standard Model Higgs boson decaying via H->ZZ->llqq, where l=e or mu, is presented. The search uses a data set of pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^-1 collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC collider. No significant excess of events above the estimated background is found. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of a Higgs boson with a mass in the range between 200 and 600 GeV are derived. A Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range 300 <= mH <= 310 GeV or 360 <= mH 400 <= GeV is excluded at 95% CL. The corresponding expected exclusion range is 360 <= mH <= 400 GeV at 95% CL.
Search for vector-like T quarks decaying to top quarks and Higgs bosons in the all-hadronic channel using jet substructure. A search is performed for a vector-like heavy T quark that is produced in pairs and that decays to a top quark and a Higgs boson. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 collected with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. For T quarks with large mass values the top quarks and Higgs bosons can have significant Lorentz boosts, so that their individual decay products often overlap and merge. Methods are applied to resolve the substructure of such merged jets. Upper limits on the production cross section of a T quark with mass between 500 and 1000 GeV/c^2 are derived. If the T quark decays exclusively to tH, the observed (expected) lower limit on the mass of the T quark is 745 (773) GeV/c^2 at 95% confidence level. For the first time an algorithm is used for tagging boosted Higgs bosons that is based on a combination of jet substructure information and b tagging.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into top and bottom quarks at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for charged Higgs bosons heavier than the top quark and decaying via H^+ → tb is presented. The data analysed corresponds to 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV and was recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The production of a charged Higgs boson in association with a top quark and a bottom quark, pp → tb H^+, is explored in the mass range from m_H^+ = 200 to 2000 GeV using multi-jet final states with one or two electrons or muons. Events are categorised according to the multiplicity of jets and how likely these are to have originated from hadronisation of a bottom quark. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate between signal and background events. No significant excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed and exclusion limits are derived for the production cross-section times branching fraction of a charged Higgs boson as a function of its mass, which range from 2.9 pb at m_H^+ = 200 GeV to 0.070 pb at m_H^+ = 2000 GeV. The results are interpreted in two benchmark scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.
Evidence for a new state in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in the H to ZZ to 4 leptons channel in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. A search for the Higgs boson in the H → ZZ four-lepton decay channel, with each Z boson decaying to an electron, a muon, or a tau pair, is reported. The search covers Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range 110 < m_H < 600 GeV. The analysis uses pp collision data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.05 fb^-1 at √(s) = 7 TeV and 5.26 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8. The four-lepton invariant-mass distributions for m_4ℓ and m_2ℓ 2τ are found to be consistent with the standard model expectations for background ZZ production for invariant masses above 180 GeV. Upper limits at 95 while the expected exclusion range is 121–570 GeV. An excess of events is observed in the low m_4ℓ mass range, making the observed limits weaker than expected in the absence of a signal. These events cluster around a mass m_4ℓ≃ 125.5 GeV, giving rise to a local excess with respect to the background expectation, with a significance of 3.2σ. This result constitutes evidence for a new massive state.
Higgs to tau tau (SM) (HCP). A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to tau pairs is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV respectively. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 17 fb^-1, 4.9 fb^-1 of data taken at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy and 12.1 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. The tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum is studied in five different final states, μτ_h+X, eτ_h+X, eμ+X, τ_hτ_h+X, and μμ+X. Upper limits with respect to the standard model prediction in the mass range of 110-145 GeV are determined. An observed (expected) 95

The search is performed using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb^-1 at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. No evidence for a signal is observed and upper limits at a 95
Study of the spin of the Higgs-like boson in the two photon decay channel using 20.7 fb-1 of pp collisions collected at √(s) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Studies of the spin of the Higgs-like boson in the H →γγ channel with the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. The dataset being used corresponds to 20.7 fb-1 of pp collisions collected at √(s) = 8 TeV. The diphoton invariant mass and the angular distribution of the photons in the resonance rest frame are used to separate signal and background, and to distinguish between the tested spin hypotheses. The Standard Model spin-0 hypothesis is confronted with a graviton-like spin-2 model with minimal couplings. Two analyses are reported and lead to compatible results. The data are in good agreement with the spin-0 hypothesis. The hypothesis of a spin-2 particle produced by gluon fusion is excluded at 99% CL, which corresponds to the expected exclusion. Results for various admixtures of qq̅ and gg production of the spin-2 resonance are also presented.
First results on Higgs to gammagamma at 13 TeV. The measurement of the Higgs boson production for the two photon decay channel with the first LHC Run 2 data is described. The analysis is performed using the dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb^-1. An event classification has been performed to maximize signal significance and to study specific Higgs boson production modes. The observed significance for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson is 1.7 σ, where a significance of 2.7 σ is expected. The best-fit signal strength relative to the standard model prediction is 0.69^+0.47_-0.42. Additional measurements include the signal strength associated with different production mechanisms.
Measurement of the associated production of a Higgs boson with a top quark pair in final states with electrons, muons and hadronically decaying τ leptons in data recorded in 2017 at √(s) = 13 TeV. The production of a Higgs boson in association with a top quark pair (ttH) is measured in final states with electrons, muons and hadronically decaying τ leptons. Events are selected from a sample of proton-proton collisions at a √(s) = 13 TeV center-of-mass energy, recorded by the CMS experiment in 2017 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.5 fb^-1. Machine learning and matrix element methods are used to optimize the analysis sensitivity. The observed (expected) ttH production rate is 0.75^+0.46_-0.43 (1.00^+0.39_-0.35) times the expected rate in the standard model, which corresponds to an observed (expected) significance of 1.7σ (2.9σ). In addition, these results are combined with those previously obtained from the data set collected in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The observed (expected) signal rate for the combined fit is 0.96^+0.34_-0.31 (1.00^+0.30_-0.27) times the expected rate in the standard model, which corresponds to an observed (expected) significance of 3.2σ (4.0σ).
Search for invisible decays of Higgs bosons in the vector boson fusion and associated ZH production modes. A search for invisible decays of Higgs bosons is performed using the vector boson fusion and associated ZH production modes. In the ZH mode, the Z boson is required to decay to a pair of charged leptons or a bb̅ quark pair. The searches use the 8 TeV pp collision dataset collected by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 19.7 inverse femtobarns. Certain channels include data from 7 TeV collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 inverse femtobarns. The searches are sensitive to non-standard-model invisible decays of the recently observed Higgs boson, as well as additional Higgs bosons with similar production modes and large invisible branching fractions. In all channels, the observed data are consistent with the expected standard model backgrounds. Limits are set on the production cross section times invisible branching fraction, as a function of the Higgs boson mass, for the vector boson fusion and ZH production modes. By combining all channels, and assuming standard model Higgs boson cross sections and acceptances, the observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible branching fraction at m_H=125 GeV is found to be 0.58 (0.44) at 95% confidence level. We interpret this limit in terms of a Higgs-portal model of dark matter interactions.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the two photon decay channel with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the two photon decay channel is reported, using 1.08 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector. No significant excess is observed in the investigated mass range of 110-150 GeV. Upper limits on the cross-section times branching ratio of between 2.0 and 5.8 times the Standard Model prediction are derived for this mass range.

This note reports on a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel with the ATLAS detector at a proton-proton center-of-mass energy of √(s)=7 TeV, with an integrated luminosity of 38 pb^-1. In the 110-140 GeV mass range, the expected upper limit on the cross-section for this search is 19-22 times larger than the Standard Model prediction. The observed exclusions range from 7 times the Standard Model prediction at 127 GeV, to 39 times at 116 GeV. A simulation-based study of signal, incorporating the best current knowledge of the detector performance, is presented and used in the limit setting.
Measurement of the Higgs boson coupling properties in the H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ decay channel at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The coupling properties of the Higgs boson are studied in the four-lepton (e, Î¼) decay channel using 36.1 fb^â1 of pp collision data from the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector. Cross sections are measured for the main production modes in several exclusive regions of the Higgs boson production phase space and are interpreted in terms of coupling modifiers. The inclusive cross section times branching ratio for H â ZZ^â decay and for a Higgs boson absolute rapidity below 2.5 is measured to be 1.â73_ââ0.23^+â0.24 (stat.)_ââ0.08^+â0.10 (exp.)âÂ±â0.04(th.) pb compared to the Standard Model prediction of 1.34Â±0.09 pb. In addition, the tensor structure of the Higgs boson couplings is studied using an effective Lagrangian approach for the description of interactions beyond the Standard Model. Constraints are placed on the non-Standard-Model CP-even and CP-odd couplings to Z bosons and on the CP-odd coupling to gluons.
Determination of the off-shell Higgs boson signal strength in the high-mass ZZ and WW final states with the ATLAS detector. Measurements of the ZZ and WW final states in the mass range above the 2m_Z and 2m_W thresholds provide a unique opportunity to measure the off-shell coupling strength of the Higgs boson. This paper presents a determination of the off-shell Higgs boson event yields normalised to the Standard Model prediction (signal strength) in the ZZ → 4ℓ, ZZ→ 2ℓ2ν and WW→ eνμν final states. The result is based on pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1 at a collision energy of √(s)=8 TeV. Using the CL_s method, the observed 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit on the off-shell signal strength is in the range 5.1–8.6, with an expected range of 6.7–11.0. In each case the range is determined by varying the unknown gg→ ZZ and gg→ WW background K-factor from higher-order QCD corrections between half and twice the value of the known signal K-factor. Assuming the relevant Higgs boson couplings are independent of the energy scale of the Higgs production, a combination with the on-shell measurements yields an observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit on Γ_H/Γ_H^SM in the range 4.5–7.5 (6.5–11.2) using the same variations of the background K-factor. Assuming that the unknown gg→ VV background K-factor is equal to the signal K-factor, this translates into an observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit on the Higgs boson total width of 22.7 (33.0) MeV.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H→ WW^(∗)→ℓνℓν decay mode using Multivariate Techniques with 4.7 fb-1 of ATLAS data at sqrts=7 TeV. A Higgs boson search in the H→ WW^(∗)→ℓνℓν (ℓ=e,μ) decay mode has been performed using multivariate techniques with proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected during 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess of events over the expected background has been observed. An upper bound is placed on the Higgs boson production cross section as a function of its mass. A Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range between 130 GeV and 281 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level, while the expected exclusion range is 127 GeV and 255 GeV.
A search for a doubly-charged Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. A search for a doubly-charged Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 inverse femtobarns, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed using events with three or more isolated charged leptons of any flavor, giving sensitivity to the decays of pair-produced triplet components Φ^++Φ^–, and Φ^++Φ^- from associated production. No excess is observed compared to the background prediction, and upper limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the Φ^++ production cross section, under specific assumptions on its branching fractions. Lower bounds on the Φ^++ mass are reported, providing significantly more stringent constraints than previously published limits.
Evidence for Higgs boson Yukawa couplings in the H→ττ decay mode with the ATLAS detector. Results of a search for H→ττ decays are presented, based on the full set of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during 2011 and 2012. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb^-1 and 20.3 fb^-1 at centre-of-mass energies of √(s) = 7 TeV and √(s) = 8 TeV respectively. All combinations of leptonic (τ→ℓνν̅ with ℓ = e, μ) and hadronic (τ→hadrons ν) tau decays are considered. An excess of events over the expected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.5 (3.5) standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the direct coupling of the recently discovered Higgs boson with mass m_H = 125 to fermions. The measured signal strength, normalised to the Standard Model expectation, of μ = 1.42 ^+0.44_-0.38 is consistent with the predicted Yukawa coupling strength in the Standard Model.

Search for the Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson and decaying into two spin-zero particles in the H → aa → 4b channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of spin-zero particles, H → aa, where the a-boson decays into b-quarks promptly or with a mean proper lifetime cτ_a up to 6 mm and has a mass in the range of 20-60 GeV, is presented. The search is performed in events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a W or Z boson, giving rise to a signature of one or two charged leptons (electrons or muons) and multiple jets from b-quark decays. The analysis is based on the dataset of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model background prediction is observed, and 95% confidence-level upper limits are derived for the production cross-sections for pp → WH, ZH and their combination, times the branching ratio of the decay chain H → aa → 4b. For a-bosons which decay promptly, the upper limit on the combination of cross-sections for WH and ZH times the branching ratio of H → aa → 4b ranges from 3.0 pb for m_a= 20 GeV to 1.3 pb for m_a = 60 GeV, assuming that the ratio of WH to ZH cross-sections follows the Standard Model prediction. For a-bosons with longer proper lifetimes, the most stringent limits are 1.8 pb and 0.6 pb, respectively, at cτ_a ∼ 0.4 mm.
Search for Neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in sqrts = 7 TeV pp collisions at ATLAS. A search for the neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is reported. The analysis is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data were recorded in 2011 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 â 4.8 fb^â1. Higgs boson decays into oppositely-charged muon or τ lepton pairs are considered for final states requiring either the presence or absence of b jets. No statistically significant excess over the expected background is observed and exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are derived for the production cross section of a generic Higgs boson, ϕ, as a function of the Higgs boson mass and for h/A/H production in the MSSM as a function of the parameters m_A and tanβ in the m_max^h scenario with μ > 0.

Combination of standard model Higgs boson searches and measurements of the properties of the new boson with a mass near 125 GeV. Results are presented from searches for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and up to 12.2 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in the mass range 110–1000 GeV in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, and bb. Updated results are presented except for the γγ mode. The significance of the recently discovered boson is now 6.9 σ. Its mass is measured to be 125.8 ±0.4 (stat) ±0.4 (syst) GeV. The event yields obtained by the different analyses targeting specific decay modes and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the SM Higgs boson. The best-fit signal strength for all channels combined, expressed in units of the SM Higgs boson cross section, is 0.88±0.21 at the measured mass. The consistency of the couplings of the observed boson with those predicted for the SM Higgs boson is tested in various ways, and no significant deviations are found. Under the assumption that the observed boson has spin zero, the data disfavour the pseudo-scalar hypothesis 0^- with a CL_s value of 2.4
Search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson to e τ and e μ in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 8 TeV. A direct search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson (H) in the H → e τ and H → e μ channels is described. The data sample used in the search was collected in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1.

Upper limits on the branching fractions, ℬ( H → e τ )< 0.69% and ℬ( H → e μ)< 0.035%, are set at the 95% confidence level. The constraint set on ℬ( H → e τ) is an order of magnitude more stringent than the existing indirect limits. The limits are used to constrain the corresponding flavour violating Yukawa couplings, absent in the standard model.

Measurements of Higgs boson production and couplings in the four-lepton channel in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The final ATLAS Run 1 measurements of Higgs boson production and couplings in the decay channel H→ ZZ^*→ℓ^+ℓ^-ℓ^'+ℓ^'-, where ℓ,ℓ^'=e or μ, are presented. These measurements were performed using pp collision data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb^-1 and 20.3 fb^-1 at center-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV, respectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ signal is observed with a significance of 8.1 standard deviations at 125.36 GeV, the combined ATLAS measurement of the Higgs boson mass from the H→γγ and H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ channels. The production rate relative to the Standard Model expectation, the signal strength, is measured in four different production categories in the H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ channel. The measured signal strength, at this mass, and with all categories combined, is 1.44 ^+0.40_-0.33. The signal strength for Higgs boson production in gluon fusion or in association with tt̅ or bb̅ pairs is found to be 1.7 ^+0.5_-0.4, while the signal strength for vector-boson fusion combined with WH/ZH associated production is found to be 0.3 ^+1.6_-0.9.
Search for a light charged Higgs boson in the H^±→ cs channel at 13 TeV. A search is conducted for a low-mass charged Higgs boson produced in a top quark decay and subsequently decaying into a charm and an antistrange quark. The data sample was recorded in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The signal search is conducted in the process of top-quark pair production, where one top quark decays to a bottom quark and a charged Higgs boson, and the other to a bottom quark and a W boson. With the W boson decaying to a charged lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino, the final state comprises an isolated lepton, missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets, of which two are tagged as b jets. To enhance the search sensitivity, one of the jets originating from the charged Higgs boson is required to satisfy a charm tagging requirement. No significant excess beyond standard model predictions is found in the dijet invariant mass distribution. An upper limit in the range 0.20-1.65

A search for Higgs bosons in decays of supersymmetric particles is presented, using the LHC proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=8 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.8 fb^-1. Higgs bosons are reconstructed in diphoton final states in association with at least one jet. The razor variables M_R and R^2 are used to categorize events into different regions to improve signal-to-background discrimination. The results are interpreted as constraints on a set of simplified SUSY benchmark models.
Measurements of the Higgs boson inclusive and differential fiducial cross sections in the 4ℓ decay channel at √(s) = 13 TeV. Inclusive and differential fiducial cross sections of the Higgs boson are measured in the H → ZZ^*→ 4ℓ (ℓ = e,μ) decay channel. The results are based on proton-proton collision data produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector from 2015 to 2018, equivalent to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. The inclusive fiducial cross section for the H → ZZ^*→ 4ℓ process is measured to be σ_fid = 3.28 ± 0.32 fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of σ_fid, SM = 3.41 ± 0.18 fb. Differential fiducial cross sections are measured for a variety of observables which are sensitive to the production and decay of the Higgs boson. All measurements are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. The results are used to constrain anomalous Higgs boson interactions with Standard Model particles.
Search for Higgs boson pair production in the bblνlν final state at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for pair-produced Higgs bosons decaying respectively into bb and VV (with V either a W or a Z boson), with subsequent VV decays into two leptons and two neutrinos, is presented. The analysis is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.30 fb^-1. The search signature is a resonance in the invariant mass distribution of the b-jet pair at the Higgs boson mass in combination with high scores of a boosted decision tree discriminant based on kinematic information. Data and predictions from the standard model (SM) are in agreement within uncertainties. For the SM hh hypothesis, the data are observed (expected) to exclude a production cross-section times branching ratio of 166.7 (92.8^+59.9_-33.4) fb, corresponding to approximately 400 times the SM cross section. Lack of deviation from the SM predictions in the observations is used to place constraints on different scenarios considering anomalous couplings which could affect the rate and kinematics of hh production.

The measured signal strength, relative to the SM expectation, is 1.19^+0.41_-0.39(stat)^+0.17_-0.16(sys). The combination of this result with that from data recorded at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV improves both expected and observed sensitivity by 1

In addition, a search for scalar resonances decaying into the four-lepton final state is performed by exploring the mass range 200-1000 GeV. In all measurements no significant deviation from SM predictions are observed.
Search for new phenomena in events with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to two photons in pp collisions at sâ=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for new phenomena in events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to two photons is presented. The search uses 13.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. No excess over the background expectation is observed. Limits are set on the production rates of the following theoretical models: two simplified models where the Standard Model–dark matter interaction is mediated by a new vector particle emitting a Higgs boson and decaying, either directly or through an intermediate state, into two invisible particles, and an effective theory model where a heavy scalar decays into a Higgs boson and a pair of dark matter candidates.
Search for a Standard Model Higgs Boson in the mass range 200-600 GeV in the channel H - gt; ZZ - gt; llqq using the ATLAS Detector.. This note describes an updated search for the Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range 200 <= mH <= 600 GeV decaying via the channel H -> ZZ -> llqq, where l = e or mu. Events with two b-tagged jets, which have a better signal-to-background ratio, are treated as a separate channel to improve the sensitivity of the search. No evidence for Higgs boson production is observed in a dataset of pp collisions corresponding to 2.05 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2011. Finally, upper limits on the Higgs-boson production cross-sections are presented and discussed.
Search for Higgs boson pair production in the γγbb final state in pp collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search is presented for the production of a pair of Higgs bosons, where one decays into two photons and the other one into a bottom quarkâantiquark pair. The analysis is performed using protonâproton collision data at s=13TeV recorded in 2016 by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fbâ1 . The results are in agreement with standard model (SM) predictions. In a search for resonant production, upper limits are set on the cross section for new spin-0 or spin-2 particles. For the SM-like nonresonant production hypothesis, the data exclude a product of cross section and branching fraction larger than 2.0fb at 95% confidence level (CL), corresponding to about 24 times the SM prediction. Values of the effective Higgs boson self-coupling ÎºÎ» are constrained to be within the range â11<ÎºÎ»<17 at 95% CL, assuming all other Higgs boson couplings are at their SM value. The constraints on ÎºÎ» are the most restrictive to date.
Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel at √(s)=8 TeV with ATLAS. Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections are presented for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=8 TeV. The analysis is performed in the H →γγ decay channel using 20.3 fb^-1 of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The signal is extracted using a fit to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum assuming that the width of the resonance is much smaller than the experimental resolution. The signal yields are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution. The pp→ H →γγ fiducial cross section is measured to be 43.2 ± 9.4 (stat) ^+3.2_-2.9 (syst) ± 1.2 (lumi) fb for a Higgs boson of mass 125.4 GeV decaying to two isolated photons that have transverse momentum greater than 35% and 25% of the diphoton invariant mass and each with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.37. Four additional fiducial cross sections and two cross-section limits are presented in phase space regions that test the theoretical modelling of different Higgs boson production mechanisms, or are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Differential cross sections are also presented, as a function of variables related to the diphoton kinematics and the jet activity produced in the Higgs boson events. The observed spectra are statistically limited but broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.
Search for anomalous couplings in the Higgs sector at LEP. We search for a Higgs particle with anomalous couplings in the e^+e^-→Hγ, e^+e^-→HZ and e^+e^-→He^+e ^- processes with the L3 detector at LEP. We explore the mass range 70 GeV < m_H < 170 GeV using 176 pb^-1 of integrated luminosity at a center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 189 GeV. The Higgs decays H→bb, H→γγ and H→ Zγ are considered in the analysis. No evidence for anomalous Higgs production is found. This is interpreted in terms of limits on the anomalous couplings d, d_B, Δ g_1^Z and Δκ_γ. Limits on the Γ(H→γγ) and Γ(H→Zγ) partial widths in the explored Higgs mass range are also obtained.
Search for an additional, heavy Higgs boson in the H→ ZZ decay channel at √(s) = 8 TeV in pp collision data with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for a high-mass Higgs boson in the H→ℓℓℓℓ, H→ℓℓνν, H→ℓℓ qq, and H→νν qq decay modes using the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The search uses proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb^-1. The results of the search are interpreted in the scenario of a heavy Higgs boson with a width that is small compared with the experimental mass resolution. The Higgs boson mass range considered extends up to 1 TeV for all four decay modes and down to as low as 140 GeV, depending on the decay mode. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model prediction is found. A simultaneous fit to the four decay modes yields upper limits on the production cross-section of a heavy Higgs boson times the branching ratio to Z boson pairs. 95% confidence level upper limits range from 0.53 pb at m_H=195 GeV to 0.008 pb at m_H=950 GeV for the gluon-fusion production mode and from 0.31 pb at m_H=195 GeV to 0.009 pb at m_H=950 GeV for the vector-boson-fusion production mode. The results are also interpreted in the context of Type-I and Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models.
A search for the Zγ decay mode of the Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Zγ decay of the Higgs boson, with Z boson decays into pairs of electrons or muons is presented. The analysis uses proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The observed data are consistent with the expected background with a p-value of 1.3%. An upper limit at 95% confidence level on the production cross-section times the branching ratio for pp→ H→ Zγ is set at 3.6 times the Standard Model prediction while 2.6 times is expected in the presence of the Standard Model Higgs boson. The best-fit value for the signal yield normalised to the Standard Model prediction is 2.0^+1.0_-0.9 where the statistical component of the uncertainty is dominant.
Measurements and interpretations of Higgs-boson fiducial cross sections in the diphoton decay channel using 139 fb^â1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Fiducial integrated and differential cross sections for the production of the Higgs boson decaying to two photons are measured using 139 fb^-1 of proton–proton collision data recorded at √(s)=13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The inclusive production cross section in a fiducial region closely matching the experimental selection of the photons is measured to be 65.2 ± 7.1 fb, which is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 63.6 ± 3.3 fb. Differential measurements are performed for a set of variables that are related to the diphoton kinematics as well as the kinematics and multiplicity of the jets produced in association with the Higgs boson. The measurements are compared to various QCD calculations and are found to be in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions. The measurements are also used to probe the strength and tensor structure of the interactions of the Higgs boson using an effective Lagrangian which introduces additional CP-even and CP-odd interactions. In addition, an interpretation of the transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs boson is performed as an indirect probe of the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to the charm quark. Resulting limits on the strength of anomalous interactions are presented for these two approaches.
Search for doubly-charged Higgs bosons in like-sign dilepton final states at √(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for doubly-charged Higgs bosons decaying to pairs of electrons and/or muons is presented. The search is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Pairs of prompt, isolated, high-pT leptons with the same electric charge (ee, emu, mumu) are selected, and their invariant mass distribution is searched for a narrow resonance. No significant excess over Standard Model background expectations is observed, and limits are placed on the cross section times branching ratio for pair production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons. The masses of doubly-charged Higgs bosons are constrained depending on the branching ratio into these leptonic final states. Assuming pair production, coupling to left-handed fermions, and a branching ratio of 100% for each final state, masses below 409 GeV, 375 GeV, and 398 GeV are excluded for ee, emu, mumu, respectively.
Searches for the Zγ decay mode of the Higgs boson and for new high-mass resonances in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This article presents searches for the ZÎ³ decay of the Higgs boson and for narrow high-mass resonances decaying to ZÎ³, exploiting Z boson decays to pairs of electrons or muons. The data analysis uses 36.1 fb^â1 of pp collisions at √(s)=13 recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The data are found to be consistent with the expected Standard Model background. The observed (expected â assuming Standard Model pp â H â ZÎ³ production and decay) upper limit on the production cross section times the branching ratio for pp â H â ZÎ³ is 6.6. (5.2) times the Standard Model prediction at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV. In addition, upper limits are set on the production cross section times the branching ratio as a function of the mass of a narrow resonance between 250 GeV and 2.4 TeV, assuming spin-0 resonances produced via gluon-gluon fusion, and spin-2 resonances produced via gluon-gluon or quark-antiquark initial states. For high-mass spin-0 resonances, the observed (expected) limits vary between 88 fb (61 fb) and 2.8 fb (2.7 fb) for the mass range from 250 GeV to 2.4 TeV at the 95% confidence level.

Combining the studies of bbγγ and bbττ final states, the expected significance for Higgs boson pair production is 1.9 standard deviation. The resulting expected uncertainty in the signal yield is 54Version of November 15, 2015: additional references included.
Search for a heavy pseudoscalar boson decaying to a Z boson and a Higgs boson at sqrt(s)=13 TeV. A search for a heavy pseudoscalar boson A decaying into a Z boson and the standard model Higgs boson is presented. In the considered final state, the Higgs boson decays to a b quark-antiquark, and the Z boson decays either into a pair of electrons, muons, or neutrinos. The analysis is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the background expectations. Exclusion limits are set in the context of two Higgs doublet models in the mass range between 225 and 1000 GeV.
Search for top quark decays via Higgs-boson-mediated flavor changing neutral currents in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for top quark decays via Higgs-boson-mediated flavor changing neutral currents pp → tt̅→ Hc + Wb in events containing a trilepton or same-sign dilepton is presented. The search is performed with a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The observed number of events agrees with the SM prediction, and no evidence for top quark decays via Higgs-boson-mediated flavor changing neutral currents are found. The measured 95 t → Hc branching fraction are 0.93 This corresponds to an observed upper limit on top-charm flavor violating Higgs Yukawa coupling of √(|λ_tc^H|^2 + |λ_ct^H|^2) < 0.18.
Search for two Higgs bosons in final states containing two photons and two bottom quarks in proton-proton collisions at 8 TeV. A search is presented for the production of two Higgs bosons in final states containing two photons and two bottom quarks. Both resonant and nonresonant hypotheses are investigated. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector. Good agreement is observed between data and predictions of the standard model (SM). Upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross section of new particles and compared to the prediction for the existence of a warped extra dimension. When the decay to two Higgs bosons is kinematically allowed, assuming a mass scale Λ_R = 1 TeV for the model, the data exclude a radion scalar at masses below 980 GeV. The first Kaluza–Klein excitation mode of the graviton in Randall–Sundrum models is excluded for masses between 325 and 450 GeV. Limits set on nonresonant production constrain the parameter space for anomalous Higgs boson couplings.
Search for a doubly-charged Higgs boson with √(s)=8 TeV pp collisions at the CMS experiment. A search for doubly-charged Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV is presented. The data corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search considers leptonic final states with three or four electrons or muons which probe the associated production of Φ^±±Φ^∓ and Drell-Yan pair production of Φ^++Φ^–. No excess over Standard Model background expectations is observed and upper limits at the 95
Search for γγ decays of a Higgs boson produced in association with a fermion pair in e^+ e^- collisions at LEP. A search for gamma-gamma decays of a Higgs boson is performed in the data sample collected at LEP with the ALEPH detector between 1991 and 1999. This corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 672 pb-1 at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 88 to 202 GeV. The search is based on topologies arising from a Higgs boson produced in association with a fermion pair via the Higgs-strahlung process e+e- -> Hff, with ff=nuν, e+e-, mu+mu-, tau+tau- or qq. Twenty-two events are selected in the data, while 28 events are expected from standard model processes. An upper limit is derived, as a function of the Higgs boson mass, on the product of the e+e- -> Hff cross section and the H -> gamma-gamma branching fraction. In particular, a fermiophobic Higgs boson produced with the standard model cross section is excluded at 95% confidence level for all masses below 100.7 GeV.
Search for supersymmetry using Higgs boson to diphoton decays at √(s) = 13 TeV with the CMS detector. A search for supersymmetry is presented where at least one Higgs boson is produced and decays to two photons in the decay chains of the pair-produced supersymmetric particles. The presence of charged leptons and additional Higgs boson candidates and various kinematic variables are used to categorize events into search regions which are sensitive to different supersymmetry scenarios. The results are based on data from proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment in 2016 and 2017, corresponding to 77.5 fb^-1. No statistically significant excess of events is observed relative to standard model expectations. We exclude bottom squark pair production for bottom squark masses below 530 GeV and an LSP mass of 1 GeV; wino-like chargino-neutralino production for chargino and neutralino masses below 235 GeV with gravitino masses of 1 GeV; and higgsino-like chargino-neutralino production for neutralino masses below 290 GeV, for the case where the neutralino decays to a Higgs boson and a gravitino 100
Search for a heavy resonance decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson in semileptonic final states at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for heavy resonances decaying into a vector boson and the standard model Higgs boson is presented, in final states containing b quark-antiquark pairs from the decay of the Higgs boson and leptons (electrons and muons) or missing transverse momentum, because of undetected neutrinos, from the decay of the vector bosons. The analysis is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the background expectations. Exclusion limits are set in the context of spin-1 heavy vector resonances and spin-0 two Higgs doublet models, also including the presence of dark matter. In a model with heavy vector triplet, W' and Z' resonances with a degenerate mass smaller than 2.9 TeV are excluded at 95
Search for Charged Higgs Bosons in e^+e^- Collisions at Centre-of-Mass Energies up to 202 GeV. A search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons is performed with the L3 detector at LEP using data collected at centre-of-mass energies between 192 and 202 GeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 233.2 pb^-1. Decays into a charm and a strange quark or into a tau lepton and its neutrino are considered. The observed events are consistent with the expectations from Standard Model background processes. Including data taken at lower centre-of-mass energies, lower limits on the charged Higgs mass are derived at the 95% confidence level. They vary from 67.4 to 79.9GeV as a function of the H^+/- –> tau nu branching ratio.
Search for a charged Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for a charged Higgs boson is performed with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 ± 0.5 fb^-1 collected with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. The charged Higgs boson is searched for in top quark decays for m_H^± lower then m_t - m_b, and in the direct production pp → t (b) H^± for m_H^± larger than m_t - m_b. The H^±→τ^±ν_τ and H^±→ t b decay modes in the final states τ_ h+jets, μτ_ h, ℓ+jets, and ℓℓ' (ℓ = e, μ) are considered in the search. No signal is observed and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the charged Higgs boson production. A model-independent upper limit on the product branching fraction ℬ( t→ H^± b) ℬ(H^±→τ^±ν_τ)= 1.2-0.15% is obtained in the mass range m_H^± = 80-160 GeV, while the upper limit on the cross section times branching fraction σ( pp → t (b) H^±) ℬ (H^±→τ^±ν_τ)= 0.38-0.025 pb is set in the mass range m_H^+ = 180-600 GeV. Here, cross section σ( pp→ t(b)H^±) stands for the sum σ( pp→ t( b) H^+) + σ( pp→ t( b) H^-). Assuming ℬ( H^±→ t b)= 1, an upper limit on σ ( pp→ t ( b) H^±) of 2.0-0.13 pb is set for m_H^± = 180-600 GeV. The combination of all considered decay modes and final states is used to set exclusion limits in the m_H^±-tanβ parameter space in different MSSM benchmark scenarios.
Search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks is performed in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a bottom quark-antiquark system that has a large Lorentz boost. The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction. Results are interpreted in terms of limits both on parameters of the type-2 two-Higgs doublet model extended by an additional light pseudoscalar boson a (2HDM+a) and on parameters of a baryonic Z' simplified model. For the baryonic Z' model, the presented results constitute the most stringent constraints to date. The 2HDM+a model is tested experimentally for the first time.
Search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalars in the final state of two muons and two τ leptons at √(s)=13 TeV.. A search for exotic Higgs boson decays to light pseudoscalars in the final state of two muons and two τ leptons is performed using 35.9 fb^-1 of data accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 15 and 62.5 GeV are probed, and no significant excess of data is observed above the prediction of the standard model. Upper limits are set on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to two light pseudoscalar bosons in different types of two-Higgs-doublet models extended with a complex scalar singlet.
Search for dark matter particles produced in association with a Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for dark matter (DM) particles is performed using events with a Higgs boson candidate and large missing transverse momentum. The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search is performed in five Higgs boson decay channels: h→bb̅, γγ, τ^+τ^-, W^+W^-, and ZZ and the results from the individual channels are combined to maximize the sensitivity of the analysis. No significant excess over the expected standard model background is observed in any of the five channels or in their combination. Limits are set on DM production in the context of two simplified models. The results are also interpreted in terms of a spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section and compared to those from direct-detection DM experiments. This is the first search for DM particles produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W or Z bosons, and the first statistical combination based on five Higgs boson decay channels.
Search for the associated production of a Higgs boson and a single top quark in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for the production of Higgs boson in association with a single top quark is presented, based on data collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The production cross section of this process is highly sensitive to the absolute values of the modifiers of the top quark-Higgs boson coupling, κ_t, and the coupling of vector bosons to the Higgs boson, κ_V, as well as their relative signs with respect to the standard model. Analyses using multilepton signatures due to H→WW, H→ττ, and H→ZZ decay modes and that with a single lepton for the decay H→bb are combined with a reinterpretation of a measurement of H→γγ to constrain κ_t. For κ_V=1.0 the observed data favor positive values of κ_t and exclude values of κ_t below about 0.9.
Search for the Associated Production of a Higgs Boson and a Top Quark Pair in Multilepton Final States with the ATLAS Detector. The Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to the top quark is a key parameter of the Standard Model, and can be constrained using the associated production process pp → tt̅ H + X. A search for this process using final states with multiple leptons, primarily targeting the decays H→ WW^* and H→ττ, has been performed using 13.2 fb^-1 of data recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016 at a center of mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV. The best-fit value of the ratio of observed and Standard Model cross sections is 2.5 ± 0.7 (stat) ^+1.1_-0.9 (syst), and an upper limit on this ratio of 4.9 (2.3 expected) is found at 95% confidence level.
Search for a light charged Higgs boson decaying to a W boson and a CP-odd Higgs boson in final states with eμμ or μμμ in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for a light charged Higgs boson (H^+) decaying to a W boson and a CP-odd Higgs boson (A) in final states with eμμ or μμμ is performed using data from pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV, recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. In this search, it is assumed that the H^+ boson is produced in decays of top quarks, and the A boson decays to two oppositely charged muons. The presence of signals for H^+ boson masses between 100 and 160 GeV and A boson masses between 15 and 75 GeV is investigated. No evidence for the production of the H^+ boson is found. Assuming branching fractions ℬ(H^+→W^+A)= 1 and ℬ(A→μ^+μ^-)=3×10^-4, upper limits at 95% confidence level on the branching fraction of the top quark, ℬ(t→bH^+), of 0.63 to 2.9% are obtained, depending on the masses of the H^+ and A bosons. These are the first limits on ℬ(t→bH^+) in the decay mode of the H^+ boson: H^+→W^+A→W^+μ^+μ^-.
Search for neutral Higgs boson in Z0 decay.
Search for Higgs Boson Production in Association with a Top-Quark Pair and Decaying to Bottom Quarks or Tau Leptons. A search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair in 19.5 fb^-1 of 8 TeV pp collision data is presented. The analysis is optimized for ttH events which are categorized into three channels based on the different final states: lepton + jets channel (tt→ℓνqq^'bb, H→bb), dilepton channel (tt→ℓ^+νℓ^-νbb, H→bb) and tau channel (tt→ℓνqq^'bb, H→τ^+τ^-). The major background to the signal is top-quark pair production with additional jets. Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques are used to discriminate between background and signal events. A simultaneous fit for signal and background is performed using the MVA output distributions. Assuming standard model Higgs boson branching fractions, a 95production cross section is presented. In addition, the results from this analysis are combined with two earlierttHanalyses that use independent datasets.

Search for additional neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in the ττ final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s)= 13 TeV. A search is presented for additional neutral Higgs bosons in the Ï Ï final state in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), using the data collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^â1. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes production of the Higgs boson in association with b quarks. No significant deviation above the expected background is observed. Model-independent limits at 95% confidence level (CL) are set on the product of the branching fraction for the decay into Ï leptons and the cross section for the production via gluon fusion or in association with b quarks. These limits range from 18 pb at 90 GeV to 3.5 fb at 3.2 TeV for gluon fusion and from 15 pb (at 90 GeV) to 2.5 fb (at 3.2 TeV) for production in association with b quarks, assuming a narrow width resonance. In the m_h^hodâ+ scenario these limits translate into a 95% CL exclusion of tan Î² > 6 for neutral Higgs boson masses below 250 GeV, where tan Î² is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the two Higgs doublets. The 95% CL exclusion contour reaches 1.6 TeV for tan Î² = 60.
Search for a light NMSSM Higgs boson produced in supersymmetric cascades and decaying into a b-quark pair. A search for a light neutral Higgs boson decaying to a pair of b-quarks, and produced together with at least two very energetic jets and large missing energy, is presented. Such Higgs bosons are conceivable in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM), with the Higgs sector characterized by two complex Higgs doublets and an additional Higgs singlet field. This could result in a light Higgs boson with a large singlet component, which would be hard to detect in conventional searches at LEP, LHC and Tevatron, but could be copiously produced in decays of neutralinos in supersymmetric cascades. The data used in this analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No indication of a signal is observed. The results are interpreted in terms of cross section limits and within the parameter space of certain NMSSM light Higgs boson scenarios.
Search for an exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalars in the final state with two muons and two b quarks in pp collisions at 13 TeV. A search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar particles a_1 is performed under the hypothesis that one of the pseudoscalars decays to a pair of opposite sign muons and the other decays to bb̅. Such signatures are predicted in a number of extensions of the standard model (SM), including next-to-minimal supersymmetry and two-Higgs-doublet models with an additional scalar singlet. The results are based on a data set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, accumulated with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No statistically significant excess is observed with respect to the SM backgrounds in the search region for pseudoscalar masses from 20 GeV to half of the Higgs boson mass. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction, σ_hℬ(h→a_1a_1→μ^+μ^-bb̅), ranging from 5 to 36 fb, depending on the pseudoscalar mass. Corresponding limits on the branching fraction, assuming the SM prediction for σ_h, are (1-6)× 10^-4.
Search for additional neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in the di-tau final state in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search is presented for additional neutral Higgs bosons in the di-τ final state in pp collisions at the LHC. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), on the data collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons the search includes the case where the Higgs boson is produced in association with b quarks. No significant deviation above the expected background is observed. Model-independent limits are set on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for the production via gluon-fusion or in association with b quarks. These limits range from 18 pb (at 90 GeV) to 3.5× 10^-3 pb (at 3.2 TeV) for gluon-fusion and from 15 pb (at 90 GeV) to 2.5× 10^-3 pb (at 3.2 TeV) for b-associated production. In the m_h^mod+ scenario these limits translate into an exclusion of tanβ>6 for m_h≲ 200 GeV. The exclusion contour ranges up to 1.6 TeV for tanβ<60.
Measurements of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel at √(s) = 13 TeV. Measurements of Higgs boson properties in events where the Higgs boson decays into a pair of photons are reported. Events with two photons are selected from a sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV collected by the CMS detector at the LHC from 2016 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. Analysis categories enriched in events produced via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, vector boson associated production, and production associated with top quarks are constructed. The total Higgs boson signal strength, relative to the standard model prediction, is measured to be 1.03^+0.11_-0.09. Other properties of the Higgs boson are measured, including standard model signal strength modifiers, production cross sections, and its couplings to other particles. All results are found to be in agreement with the standard model expectations.

The analysis is performed using LHC data recorded with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.1 fb^-1. W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with two leptons, electrons or muons. No significant excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed, and upper limits on Higgs boson production are derived, excluding the presence of a Higgs boson with a mass in [150 - 193] GeV/c^2 range at 95
A search for the dimuon decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. A search for the dimuon decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson is performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1 collected in Run 2 with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess is observed above the expected background. The observed upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio is 1.7 times the Standard Model prediction at 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV, while the expected limit in the absence (assuming SM signal yield) of a H→μμ signal is 1.3 (2.2). The measured signal strength, defined as the ratio of the observed signal yield to the one expected in the Standard Model, is μ = 0.5 ± 0.7.
Search for direct production of charginos and neutralinos decaying via the 125 GeV Higgs boson in √(s) = 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search for the direct pair production of charginos and neutralinos pp→χ̃_1^±χ̃_2^0 is presented, where the chargino decays via a W boson χ̃_1^±→χ̃_1^0 (W^±→ℓ^±ν), while the neutralino decays via the 125 GeV Higgs boson χ̃_2^0→χ̃_1^0 (h→ bb/γγ/ℓ^±ν qq) to the lightest neutralino. The final states considered for the search have large missing transverse momentum, an isolated electron or muon, and one of the following: either two jets identified as originating from bottom quarks, or two photons, or a second electron or muon with the same electric charge. The analysis is based on 20.3 fb^-1 of √(s)=8 TeV proton–proton collision data delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded with the ATLAS detector. Observations are consistent with the Standard Model expectations, and limits are set in the context of a simplified supersymmetric model within which, in the case where the χ̃_1^0 is massless, the direct production of χ̃_1^± and χ̃_2^0 of equal mass below 250 GeV is excluded.
Search for doubly-charged Higgs bosons in same-charge electron pair final states using proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for doubly-charged Higgs bosons decaying to pairs of same-charge, isolated, high-pT electrons is presented. Same-charge electron pairs are selected in an inclusive way and the same-charge electron pair invariant mass spectrum is studied. The search uses the pp collision data sample corresponding to 13.9 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC at the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. A model independent search for new physics processes was performed and no clear evidence for an excess was observed. Therefore, the upper limits for the signal cross-sections were set at 95% confidence level. Consequently, the observed lower mass limits, assuming a 100
Search for exclusive Higgs and Z boson decays to ϕγ and ργ with the ATLAS detector. A search for the exclusive decays of the Higgs and Z bosons to a ϕ or ρ meson and a photon is performed with a pp collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 35.6 fb^-1 collected at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. These decays have been suggested as a probe of the Higgs boson couplings to light quarks. No significant excess of events is observed above the background, as expected from the Standard Model. Upper limits at 95% confidence level were obtained on the branching fractions of the Higgs boson decays to ϕγ and ργ of 4.8×10^-4 and 8.8×10^-4, respectively. The corresponding 95% confidence level upper limits for the Z boson decays are 0.9×10^-6 and 25×10^-6 for ϕγ and ργ, respectively.
Search for resonant pair production of Higgs bosons decaying to two bottom quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at 8 TeV. A model-independent search for a narrow resonance produced in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV and decaying to a pair of 125 GeV Higgs bosons that in turn each decays into bottom quark-antiquark pairs is performed by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 17.9 fb^-1. No evidence for a signal is observed. Upper limits at a 95% confidence level on the production cross section for such a resonance, in the mass range from 270 to 1100 GeV, are reported. Using these results, a radion with decay constant of 1 TeV and mass from 300 to 1100 GeV, and a Kaluza–Klein graviton with mass from 380 to 830 GeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level.
Searches for neutral Higgs bosons in e+e- collisions at LEP.
Search for WH production with a light Higgs boson decaying to prompt electron-jets in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is performed for WH production with a light Higgs boson decaying to hidden-sector particles resulting in clusters of collimated electrons, known as electron-jets. The search is performed with 2.04 fb-1 of data collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. One event satisfying the signal selection criteria is observed, which is consistent with the expected background rate. Limits on the product of the WH production cross section and the branching ratio of a Higgs boson decaying to prompt electron-jets are calculated as a function of a Higgs boson mass in the range from 100 GeV to 140 GeV.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a vector boson and decaying to a b-quark pair with the ATLAS detector. This Letter presents the results of a direct search with the ATLAS detector at the LHC for a Standard Model Higgs boson of mass 110 ≤ m_H ≤ 130 GeV produced in association with a W or Z boson and decaying to bb̅. Three decay channels are considered: ZH → l^+ l^- bb̅, WH → lν bb̅, and ZH →νν̅bb̅, where l corresponds to an electron or a muon. No evidence for Higgs boson production is observed in a dataset of 7 TeV pp collisions corresponding to 4.7/fb of integrated luminosity collected by ATLAS in 2011. Exclusion limits on Higgs boson production, at the 95% confidence level, of 2.5 to 5.5 times the Standard Model cross section are obtained in the mass range 110 - 130 GeV. The expected exclusion limits range between 2.5 and 4.9 for the same mass interval.
Search for a standard model-like Higgs boson in the μ^+μ^- and e^+e^- decay channels at the LHC. A search is presented for a standard model-like Higgs boson decaying to the μ^+μ^- or e^+e^- final states based on proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.0fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV for the μ^+μ^- search, and of 19.7 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV for the e^+e^- search. To enhance the sensitivity of the search, events are categorized by topologies according to production process and dilepton invariant mass resolution. Upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction at the 95% confidence level are reported for Higgs boson masses in the range from 120 to 150GeV. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125GeV decaying to μ^+μ^-, the observed (expected) upper limit on the production rate is found to be 7.4 (6.5^+2.8_-1.9) times the standard model value. This corresponds to an upper limit on the branching fraction of 0.0016. Similarly, for e^+e^-, an upper limit of 0.0019 is placed on the branching fraction, which is ≈3.7×10^5 times the standard model value. These results, together with recent evidence of the 125GeV boson coupling to τ-leptons with a larger branching fraction consistent with the standard model, show for the first time that the leptonic couplings of the new boson are not flavour-universal.
Search for the Higgs boson in the H- gt;WW- gt;lvjj decay channel using 4.7 fb-1 of pp collisions at sqrts = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson has been performed in the H→ WW→ℓν jj channel in 4.7 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Higgs boson candidates produced in association with zero, one, or two jets are included in the analysis to maximize the acceptance for both gluon fusion and weak boson fusion Higgs boson production processes. No significant excess of events is observed over the expected background and limits on the Higgs boson production cross section are derived for a Higgs boson mass in the range 300 GeV<<600 GeV. The best sensitivity is reached for = 400, where the observed (expected) 95
Search for dark photons in decays of Higgs bosons produced in association with Z bosons in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is presented for a Higgs boson that is produced in association with a Z boson and that decays to an undetected particle together with an isolated photon. The search is performed by the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1 recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess of events above the expectation from the standard model background is found. The results are interpreted in the context of a theoretical model in which the undetected particle is a massless dark photon. An upper limit is set on the product of the cross section for associated Higgs and Z boson production and the branching fraction for such a Higgs boson decay, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. For a mass of 125 GeV, assuming the standard model production cross section, this corresponds to an observed (expected) upper limit on this branching fraction of 4.6 (3.6)% at 95% confidence level. These are the first limits on Higgs boson decays to final states that include an undetected massless dark photon.
Constraints on off-shell Higgs boson production and the Higgs boson total width in ZZ→ 4ℓ and ZZ→ 2ℓ2ν final states with the ATLAS detector. A measurement of off-shell Higgs boson production in the ZZ→4ℓ and ZZ→2ℓ2ν decay channels, where ℓ stands for either an electron or a muon, is performed using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV. The data were collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015 and 2016 at the Large Hadron Collider, and they correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1. An observed (expected) upper limit on the off-shell Higgs signal strength, defined as the event yield normalised to the Standard Model prediction, of 3.8 (3.4) is obtained at 95% confidence level (CL). Assuming the ratio of the Higgs boson couplings to the Standard Model predictions is independent of the momentum transfer of the Higgs production mechanism considered in the analysis, a combination with the on-shell signal-strength measurements yields an observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit on the Higgs boson total width of 14.4 (15.2) MeV.
Search for light neutral Higgs particles produced in Z0 decays.
Search for charged Higgs bosons with the H^±→τ^±ν_τ decay channel in the fully hadronic final state at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for charged Higgs bosons in decays of H^±→τ^±ν_τ is presented both with mass larger than the top quark in the pp→H^± tb production process, and lighter than the top quark in the pp→H^±W^∓ bb̅ channel. The fully hadronic final state is considered. The search is performed using the 2016 data collected by CMS at √(s)=13 TeV, and that correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb^ -1. The observation agrees with the standard model prediction. Limits on the charged Higgs boson cross section times branching fraction are set for the mass range of 180 GeV < m_H^± < 3 TeV, while limits on the branching fraction of top quark to charged Higgs boson are set in the mass range of 80 to 160 GeV, and results are interpreted in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in e^+ e^- collisions at energies up to √(s) = 189 GeV. The data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 188.6 GeV by ALEPH at LEP, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 176.2 pb-1, are analysed in a search for pair-produced charged Higgs bosons H+/-. Three analyses are employed to select the taunutaunu, taunucs and cscs final states. No evidence for a signal is found. Upper limits are set on the production cross section as a function of the branching fraction BR(H+ to tau nu) and of the mass M(H+), assuming that the sum of the branching ratios is equal to one. In the framework of a two-Higgs-doublet model, charged Higgs bosons with masses below 65.4 GeV/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level independently of the decay mode.
Search for resonant pair production of Higgs bosons decaying to bottom quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. A search for a narrow-width resonance decaying into two Higgs bosons, each decaying into a bottom quark-antiquark pair, is presented. The search is performed using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 at √(s)= 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. No evidence for such a signal is observed. Upper limits are set on the product of the production cross section for the resonance and the branching fraction for the selected decay mode in the resonance mass range from 260 to 1200 GeV.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to tau pairs produced in association with a W or Z boson. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to tau pairs is presented using data collected in 2011 and 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC. The topologies studied represent three or four lepton final states, where the Higgs boson is produced in association with the leptonic decay of a W or Z boson, respectively. The analyses use collision data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5 fb^-1 collected at √(s)=7 TeV and 12 fb^-1 of 8 TeV. Upper limits between 2.7 and 5.5 times the standard model prediction are established on the product of Higgs boson cross section and tau pair decay branching fraction for Higgs masses between 110 and 145 GeV.
Search for charged Higgs bosons in the τ+jets final state with pp collision data recorded at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS experiment. The experimental observation of charged Higgs bosons, H^±, which are predicted by many models with an extended Higgs sector, would indicate physics beyond the Standard Model. This note presents the results of a search for charged Higgs bosons in 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS experiment, using the τ + jets channel with a hadronically decaying τ lepton in the final state. For light charged Higgs bosons ( m_H^+ < m_top), the tt̅→ H^+bWb production mode is dominant, while for heavy charged Higgs bosons, associated production of tH^+ is dominant. No evidence for a charged Higgs boson is found. For the mass range 90 GeV < m_H^+ <160 GeV, 95
CP Properties of Higgs Boson Interactions with Top Quarks in the ttH and tH Processes Using H â Î³Î³ with the ATLAS Detector. A study of the CP properties of the interaction between the Higgs boson and top quarks is presented. Higgs bosons are identified via the diphoton decay channel (H →γγ) and their production in association with a top quark pair (tt̅H) or single top quark (tH) is studied. The analysis uses 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded at a center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. It is performed using a fit to the diphoton invariant mass m_γγ distribution in events categorized using two independent boosted decision trees. Twelve categories are used for events where top quarks decay hadronically and eight for events where at least one top quark decays leptonically. Assuming a CP-even coupling, the tt̅H process is observed with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations. The tH production process is not observed and an upper limit on its rate of 12 times the Standard Model expectation is set. A CP-mixing angle greater than 43^∘ is excluded at 95% confidence level.
Search for pair production of neutral Higgs bosons in Z0 decays.
Evidence for the 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons. A search for a standard model Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 inverse-femtobarns at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, and 19.7 inverse-femtobarns at 8 TeV. Each tau lepton decays hadronically or leptonically to an electron or a muon, leading to six different final states for the tau-lepton pair, all considered in this analysis. An excess of events is observed over the expected background contributions, with a local significance larger than 3 standard deviations for m_H values between 115 and 130 GeV. The best fit of the observed H →τ-τ signal cross section for m_H = 125 GeV is 0.78 +/- 0.27 times the standard model expectation. These observations constitute evidence for the 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying to a pair of tau leptons.
Reconstruction and identification of boosted di-τ systems in a search for Higgs boson pairs using 13 TeV proton-proton collision data in ATLAS. In this note, a novel technique, referred to as the di-τ tagger, is designed to reconstruct and identify hadronically decaying τ^+τ^- pairs with a large Lorentz boost in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. A benchmark di-τ tagging selection is employed in the search for resonant Higgs boson pair production, where one Higgs boson decays into a boosted bb̅ pair and the other into a boosted τ^+τ^- pair, with two hadronically decaying τ-leptons in the final state. The efficiency of the di-τ tagger is measured for this benchmark using 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and the background with quark- or gluon-initiated jets misidentified as di-τ objects is estimated. The search for a heavy, narrow-width, scalar resonance produced via gluon-gluon fusion and decaying into two Higgs bosons is carried out in the mass range 1-3 TeV using the same dataset. No deviations from the Standard Model predictions are observed and 95% confidence-level exclusion limits are set on this model.
Study of (W/Z)H production and Higgs boson couplings using H → WW^∗ decays with the ATLAS detector. A search for Higgs boson production in association with a W or Z boson, in the H → WW^∗ decay channel, is performed with a data sample collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies √(s)=7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb^-1 and 20.3 fb^-1, respectively. The WH production mode is studied in two-lepton and three-lepton final states, while two-lepton and four-lepton final states are used to search for the ZH production mode. The observed significance, for the combined WH and ZH production, is 2.5 standard deviations while a significance of 0.9 standard deviations is expected in the Standard Model Higgs boson hypothesis. The ratio of the combined WH and ZH signal yield to the Standard Model expectation, μ_VH, is found to be μ_VH =3.0^+1.3_-1.1 ( stat.)^+1.0_-0.7 ( sys.) for the Higgs boson mass of 125.36 GeV. The WH and ZH production modes are also combined with the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes studied in the H → WW^* →ℓνℓν decay channel, resulting in an overall observed significance of 6.5 standard deviations and μ_ ggF+VBF+VH = 1.16^+0.16_-0.15 (stat.)^+0.18_-0.15 (sys.). The results are interpreted in terms of scaling factors of the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons (k_V) and fermions (k_F); the combined results are: |κ_V| = 1.06^+0.10_-0.10, |κ_F| = 0.85^+0.26_-0.20.
Search for the Higgs Boson in the Fully Leptonic W^+W^- Final State. This paper reports on a search for the Higgs boson decaying to ^+^- in pp collisions at √(s) = 7 TeV. The data were collected at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with the Compact Muon Solenoid detector, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6. ^+^- candidates are selected in events with two leptons (electrons or muons) and missing transverse energy. No significant excess above Standard Model background expectations is observed, and upper limits on the Higgs boson production are derived. The Standard Model Higgs boson is excluded in the mass range [129 - 270] at 95
Measurements of differential Higgs boson production cross sections in the leptonic WW decay mode at √(s) = 13 TeV. Measurements of differential production cross sections of the Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV are performed using events where the Higgs boson decays into a pair of W bosons which subsequently decay into an electron, a muon, and a pair of neutrinos. The analysis is based on data collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. Production cross sections with respect to the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson and the number of hadronic jets are considered. Higgs boson signal spectra are extracted and simultaneously unfolded to correct for selection efficiency and resolution effects by means of maximum likelihood fits to the observed event distributions.
Search for Neutral Higgs Bosons in e^+e^- Collisions at √(s)∼ 189 GeV. A search for neutral Higgs bosons has been performed with the OPAL detector at LEP, using approximately 170 pb-1 of e+e- collision data collected at sqrt(s) 189GeV. Searches have been performed for the Standard Model (SM) process e+e- to H0Z0 and the MSSM processes e+e- to H0Z0, A0h0. The searches are sensitive to the b b-bar and tau antitau decay modes of the Higgs bosons, and also to the MSSM decay mode h0 to A0A0. OPAL search results at lower centre-of-mass energies have been incorporated in the limits we set, which are valid at the 95% confidence level. For the SM Higgs boson, we obtain a lower mass bound of 91.0 GeV. In the MSSM, our limits are mh>74.8GeV and mA>76.5GeV, assuming tan(beta)>1, that the mixing of the scalar top quarks is either zero or maximal, and that the soft SUSY-breaking masses are 1 TeV. For the case of zero scalar top mixing, we exclude values of tan(beta) between 0.72 and 2.19.
MSSM Higgs production in association with b quarks - all hadronic. A search for a neutral Higgs boson produced in association with at least one additional b quark and decaying into a pair of b quarks, is performed in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.0 fb^-1, recorded by the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. This search is particularly sensitive to Higgs bosons in MSSM scenarios with large values of tanβ. Upper limits on the pp → bH+X, H→ bb̅ cross section are derived, and interpreted in terms of bounds in the MSSM (M_A, tanβ) parameter space.
Observation of Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks. The observation of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson decay to a pair of bottom quarks is presented. The main contribution to this result is from processes in which Higgs bosons are produced in association with a W or Z boson (VH), and are searched for in final states including 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons and two identified bottom quark jets. The results from the measurement of these processes in a data sample recorded by the CMS experiment in 2017, comprising 41.3ââfb-1 of proton-proton collisions at s=13ââTeV, are described. When combined with previous VH measurements using data collected at s=7, 8, and 13Â TeV, an excess of events is observed at mH=125ââGeV with a significance of 4.8 standard deviations, where the expectation for the SM Higgs boson is 4.9. The corresponding measured signal strength is 1.01Â±0.22. The combination of this result with searches by the CMS experiment for HâbbÂ¯ in other production processes yields an observed (expected) significance of 5.6 (5.5) standard deviations and a signal strength of 1.04Â±0.20.
Search for top-squark pair production with Higgs and Z bosons in the final state in pp collisions at 8 TeV. A search for direct top-squark pair production with Higgs or Z bosons in the decay final state is performed using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=8 TeV, collected by the CMS detector at the LHC that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb^-1. The search is performed in a sample of events containing leptons and b jets. No evidence for a significant excess of events over the standard model background prediction is observed. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified models with pair production of a heavier top-squark mass eigenstate t̃_2 decaying to a lighter top-squark mass eigenstate t̃_1 via either t̃_2→Ht̃_1 or t̃_2→Zt̃_1, followed in both cases by t̃_1→tχ̃_1^0. The interpretation is performed in the region of signal mass parameter space m_t̃_1 - m_χ̃_1^0∼ m_t, which so far is not probed by existing searches for direct top-squark pair production. The analysis excludes top squarks with masses m_t̃_2<575 GeV and m_t̃_1<400 GeV at the 95
Search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to charm quarks. A direct search for the standard model Higgs boson H produced in association with a W or Z boson and decaying to a charm quark pair is presented. The search uses a dataset of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search is carried out in mutually exclusive categories defined by the lepton multiplicity of the vector boson decays: W→ℓν, Z→ℓℓ, and Z→νν, where ℓ is an electron or a muon. To fully exploit the topology of the H decay, two strategies are followed. In one, the H candidate is reconstructed via two resolved jets arising from the two charm quarks from the H decay. This strategy mainly targets events with lower vector boson transverse momentum. A second strategy identifies the case where the two charm quarks from the H decay merge to form a single jet, which generally only occurs when the vector boson has higher transverse momentum. Both strategies make use of novel methods for charm jet identification, while jet substructure techniques are also exploited to suppress the background for the merged-jet topology. The two analyses are combined to yield an observed (expected) upper limit on the σ(VH) ×ℬℛ(H→cc̅)/σ_SM(VH) ×ℬℛ_SM(H→cc̅) of 70 (37^+16_-10) at 95
Searches for lepton-flavour-violating decays of the Higgs boson in √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. This Letter presents direct searches for lepton flavour violation in Higgs boson decays, H→ eτ and H→μτ, performed with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The searches are based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1. No significant excess is observed above the expected background from Standard Model processes. The observed (median expected) 95% confidence-level upper limits are 0.47% (0.34^+0.13_-0.10%) and 0.28% (0.37^+0.14_-0.10%) for H→ eτ and H→μτ, respectively.
Measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates and constraints on its couplings from a combined ATLAS and CMS analysis of the LHC pp collision data at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV. Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes and of the H → ZZ, WW, γγ, ττ, bb and μμ decay modes. All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined Higgs boson mass measurement by ATLAS and CMS. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision datasets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS detectors in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb^-1 at √(s)=7 TeV and 20 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8 TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates of the two experiments are combined within the context of two generic parameterisations: one based on ratios of cross sections and branching ratios and the other based on ratios of coupling modifiers, introduced within the context of a leading-order Higgs boson coupling framework. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model expectation is measured to be 1.09 ± 0.11 and the combination of the two experiments leads to observed significances of the VBF production process and of the H→ττ decay at the level of 5.4σ and 5.5σ, respectively. Several interpretations of the results with more model-dependent parameterisations, derived from the generic ones, are also given. The data are consistent with the Standard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with top quarks and decaying into a bb̅ pair in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair, tt̅H, is presented. The analysis uses 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The search targets the H → bb̅ decay mode. The selected events contain either one or two electrons or muons from the top-quark decays, and are then categorized according to the number of jets and how likely these are to contain b-hadrons. Multivariate techniques are used to discriminate between signal and background events, the latter being dominated by tt̅ + jets production. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, the ratio of the measured tt̅H signal cross-section to the Standard Model expectation is found to be μ = 0.84^+0.64_-0.61. A value of μ greater than 2.0 is excluded at 95% confidence level while the expected upper limit is μ < 1.2 in the absence of a tt̅H signal.
Search for Excess Higgs production in diphoton final states using the razor variables at √(s)=13 TeV. An inclusive search for anomalous Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel and in association with at least one jet is presented, using the LHC proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The razor variables M_R and R^2 as well as the momentum and mass resolution of the diphoton system are used to categorize events into different search regions. The search result is interpreted in the context of bottom squark pair production. Constraints are set on the production cross section as a function of the bottom squark and neutralino masses, and are translated into mass exclusion bounds.
Search for Higgs and Z boson decays to J/ψ or Υ pairs in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search is presented for decays of the Higgs and Z boson to pairs of J/ψ or Υ(nS) (n=1,2,3), with the subsequent decay of the mesons to μ^+μ^-. The analysis uses data from proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 37.5 fb^-1 at √(s)=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2017. An observation of such a decay with this sample would indicate the presence of physics beyond the standard model. No significant excess of events is observed and 95
Search for a high-mass Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W bosons in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for a high-mass Higgs boson H is performed in the H â WW â lÎ½lÎ½ and H â WW â lÎ½qq decay channels using pp collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb-1, collected at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No evidence of a high-mass Higgs boson is found. Limits on ÏH Ã BR(HâWW) as a function of the Higgs boson mass mH are obtained in the mass range between 600 and 3000 GeV.
Search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson in the boosted μμττ final state in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for a light pseudoscalar Higgs boson (a) decaying from the 125 GeV (or a heavier) scalar Higgs boson (H) is performed using the 2016 LHC proton-proton collision data at √(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, collected by the CMS experiment. The analysis considers gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production of the H, followed by the decay H→aa→μμττ, and considers pseudoscalar masses in the range 3.6 < m_a < 21 GeV. Because of the large mass difference between the H and the a bosons and the small masses of the a boson decay products, both the μμ and the ττ pairs have high Lorentz boost and are collimated. The ττ reconstruction efficiency is increased by modifying the standard technique for hadronic τ lepton decay reconstruction to account for a nearby muon. No significant signal is observed. Model-independent limits are set at 95% confidence level, as a function of m_a, on the branching fraction (ℬ) for H→aa→μμττ, down to 1.5 (2.0) × 10^-4 for m_H = 125 (300) GeV. Model-dependent limits on ℬ(H→aa) are set within the context of two Higgs doublets plus singlet models, with the most stringent results obtained for Type-III models. These results extend current LHC searches for heavier a bosons that decay to resolved lepton pairs and provide the first such bounds for an H boson with a mass above 125 GeV.
Combination of searches for invisible Higgs boson decays with the ATLAS experiment. Dark matter particles, if sufficiently light, may be produced in decays of the Higgs boson. This document presents a statistical combination of searches for the resulting H→invisible (inv) decays where H is produced according to the Standard Model via vector boson fusion, Z(ℓℓ)H(inv), and W/Z(had)H(inv), all performed with the ATLAS detector using 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 13 TeV at the LHC. In combination with the results at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV, an exclusion limit on the H→inv branching ratio of ℬ_H→inv < 0.26 (0.17^+0.07_-0.05) at 95% confidence level is observed (expected).
Search for direct pair production of a chargino and a neutralino decaying to the 125 GeV Higgs boson in √(s) = 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for the direct pair production of a chargino and a neutralino pp→χ̃^±_1χ̃^0_2, where the chargino decays to the lightest neutralino and the W boson, χ̃^±_1 →χ̃^0_1 (W^±→ℓ^±ν), while the neutralino decays to the lightest neutralino and the 125 GeV Higgs boson, χ̃^0_2 →χ̃^0_1 (h→ bb/γγ/ℓ^±ν qq). The final states considered for the search have large missing transverse momentum, an isolated electron or muon, and one of the following: either two jets identified as originating from bottom quarks, or two photons, or a second electron or muon with the same electric charge. The analysis is based on 20.3 fb^-1 of √(s)=8 TeV proton-proton collision data delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded with the ATLAS detector. Observations are consistent with the Standard Model expectations, and limits are set in the context of a simplified supersymmetric model.
Search for Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs bosons H/A and for a Z^' boson in the ττ final state produced in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. A search for neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and for a heavy neutral Z^' boson is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb^-1 from proton–proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to a τ^+ τ^- pair with at least one τ lepton decaying to final states with hadrons and a neutrino. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2–1.2 TeV for the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons and 0.5–2.5 TeV for the heavy neutral Z^' boson. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model and hence results are given as upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of the boson decay to τ^+τ^- as a function of the boson mass. The results are interpreted in MSSM and Z^' benchmark scenarios. The most stringent MSSM parameter space constraints for the Higgs boson search exclude at 95
Searches for a heavy scalar boson H decaying to a pair of 125 GeV Higgs bosons hh or for a heavy pseudoscalar boson A decaying to Zh, in the final states with h→ττ. A search for a heavy scalar boson H decaying into a pair of lighter standard-model-like 125 GeV Higgs bosons h and a search for a heavy pseudoscalar boson A decaying into a Z and an h boson are presented. The searches are performed on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1 of pp collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected by CMS in 2012. A final state consisting of two τ leptons and two b jets is used to search for the H → h h decay. A final state consisting of two τ leptons from the h boson decay, and two additional leptons from the Z boson decay, is used to search for the decay A → Z h. The results are interpreted in the context of both the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model and two-Higgs-doublet models. No excess is found above the standard model expectation and upper limits are set on the heavy boson production cross sections in the mass ranges 260 < m_H < 350 GeV and 220 < m_A < 350 GeV.
Search for electroweak production of higgsinos in channels with two Higgs bosons decaying to b quarks in pp collisions at 8 TeV. A search is presented for the electroweak pair production of higgsinos, both of which decay to a Higgs boson and an almost massless, lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Each Higgs boson is reconstructed in its decay to a bottom quark-antiquark pair. The LSPs are presumed to be undetected, leading to missing transverse energy. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions collected in 2012 by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. For higgsino masses between about 270 and 350 GeV, the expected 95 reach the level of the predicted production cross section. Because of a slight excess in the observed number of events compared to the estimated background, no exclusion is obtained for any higgsino mass value.
Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into a top quark and a bottom quark at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into a top quark and a bottom quark is presented. The data analysed correspond to 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The production of a heavy charged Higgs boson in association with a top quark and a bottom quark, pp→ tbH^+→ tbtb, is explored in the H^+ mass range from 200 to 2000 GeV using final states with jets and one electron or muon. Events are categorised according to the multiplicity of jets and b-tagged jets, and multivariate analysis techniques are used to discriminate between signal and background events. No significant excess above the background-only hypothesis is observed and exclusion limits are derived for the production cross-section times branching ratio of a charged Higgs boson as a function of its mass; they range from 3.6 pb at 200 GeV to 0.035 pb at 2000 GeV at 95% confidence level. The results are interpreted in the hMSSM and M_h^125 scenarios.
Search for the rare decays of Z bosons and Higgs bosons to J/ψ plus photon at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for decays of Z and Higgs bosons to J/ψ and a photon, with the subsequent decay of the J/ψ to μ^+μ^-, in proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy (√(s)) of 13 TeV, is presented. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. The observed (expected) upper limit on the Z→J/ψ γ decay branching fraction, assuming that the J/ψ is unpolarized, is 1.4 (1.6)×10^-6 at 95
Search for a pseudoscalar boson in the mass range from 4 to 15 GeV produced in decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the final states with two muons and two nearby tracks at √(s)=13 TeV. A search is presented for pairs of light pseudoscalar bosons, in the mass range between 4 and 15GeV, produced in decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. The decay mode where one light boson decays into τ leptons, while the other one decays into a pair of τ leptons or muons, is considered. The search is based on proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. No significant excess of events above the standard model background expectation obtained from control regions in data is observed. The 95
Search for the standard model Higgs boson in the dimuon decay channel in pp collisions at sqrt(s)= 7 and 8 TeV. We present the results of a search for the standard model Higgs boson production in the rare μ^+μ^- decay channel in proton-proton collisions at . The data samples, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.0±0.1 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and of 19.7±0.5 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. To enhance the Higgs signal over the dominant Drell-Yan background, the events are categorized by topologies corresponding to different production processes. Upper limits on the production cross section at the 95 %and 1.6 σ after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect is observed. Results of the first search for the Higgs boson production in the rare decay e^+e^- is also reported.
Search for the associated production of a Higgs boson with a single top quark in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. This paper presents the search for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark, using data collected in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. The search exploits a variety of Higgs boson decay modes resulting in final states with photons, bottom quarks, and multiple charged leptons, including tau leptons, and employs a variety of multivariate techniques to maximize sensitivity to the signal.The analysis is optimized for the opposite sign of the Yukawa coupling to that in the standard model and corresponding to a large enhancement of the signal cross section. In the absence of an excess of candidate signal events over the background predictions, 95% confidence level observed (expected) upper limits on anomalous tHq production are set, ranging between 600 (450) fb and 1000 (700) fb depending on the assumed diphoton branching fraction of the Higgs boson. This is the first time that results on anomalous tHq production have been reported.
Search for associated production of the Higgs boson in the WHâ WWW(â)â lÎ½lÎ½lÎ½ and ZHâ ZWW(â)â lllÎ½lÎ½ channels with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A search for the Higgs boson in the WH and ZH associated production modes, with Hâ WW(â) and all vector bosons decaying to electrons or muons, is performed using 20.7 fbâ1 of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The 2012 result is combined with an earlier search for WHâ WWW(â)â lÎ½lÎ½lÎ½ with 4.7 fbâ1 of data recorded at a centre-of- mass energy of 7 TeV. No significant excess is observed over the Standard Model expecta- tions, with or without a mH = 125 GeV Higgs boson. Limits at 95% confidence level on the cross section ratio to the Standard Model prediction are set for the mass interval 110 GeV â¤ mH â¤ 200 GeV. The observed (expected) limits are determined to be 7.2 (3.6) times the Standard Model cross section for a Higgs boson of mass mH=125 GeV.
Updated ATLAS results on the signal strength of the Higgs-like boson for decays into WW and heavy fermion final states. An update of the ATLAS measurement of the signal strength in various decay modes obtained by updating the low mass resolution Higgs boson searches in H->WW->lvlv, H->tautau and H->bb with 13 fb-1 of pp collision data collected at the LHC at sqrts=8TeV is presented. The combination of all final states, including the already published H->ZZ->llll and H->gammagamma results, gives a signal strength of mu=1.3 +/- 0.3 for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 126 GeV.
Evidence for a particle decaying to W+W- in the fully leptonic final state in a standard model Higgs boson search in pp collisions at the LHC. An update of a previous search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to W^+W^- in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV is reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.1 ± 0.5 fb^-1, collected by the CMS detector at the LHC in 2012. The 2011 results obtained at √(s) = 7 TeV for an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb^-1 are added to the present analysis. The W^+W^- candidates are selected in events with two oppositely charged leptons and large missing transverse momentum. An excess of events is observed above background which is consistent with the expectations from a standard model Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV and has a statistical significance of 3.1 standard deviations for this mass. This result provides evidence for a Higgs-like particle decaying to W^+W^-. No other excess of events is observed over the full accessible mass range. Additional standard model Higgs-like bosons are excluded in the mass range 128-600 GeV at 95
Search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying into two photons in pp collisions at √(s)=7 TeV. A search for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons is described. The analysis is performed using a dataset recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 inverse femtobarns. Limits are set on the cross section of the standard model Higgs boson decaying to two photons. The expected exclusion limit at 95% confidence level is between 1.4 and 2.4 times the standard model cross section in the mass range between 110 and 150 GeV. The analysis of the data excludes, at 95% confidence level, the standard model Higgs boson decaying into two photons in the mass range 128 to 132 GeV. The largest excess of events above the expected standard model background is observed for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 124 GeV with a local significance of 3.1 sigma. The global significance of observing an excess with a local significance greater than 3.1 sigma anywhere in the search range 110-150 GeV is estimated to be 1.8 sigma. More data are required to ascertain the origin of this excess.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H → WW^(*)→ lν lν decay mode with 4.7 fb^-1 of ATLAS data at √(s) = 7 TeV. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H → WW^(*)→ lν lν (l = e, μ) decay mode is presented. The search is performed using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected during 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess of events over the expected background is observed. An upper bound is placed on the Higgs boson production cross section as a function of its mass. A Standard Model Higgs boson with mass in the range between 133 GeV and 261 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level, while the expected exclusion range is from 127 GeV to 233 GeV.
Search for direct top squark pair production in events with a Higgs or Z boson, and missing transverse momentum in √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector. A search for direct top squark pair production resulting in events with either a same-flavour opposite-sign dilepton pair with invariant mass compatible with a Z boson or a pair of jets compatible with a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson (h) is presented. Requirements on additional leptons, jets, jets identified as originating from b-quarks, and missing transverse momentum are imposed to target the other decay products of the top squark pair. The analysis is performed using proton-proton collision data at √(s)=13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015-2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1. No excess is observed in the data with respect to the expected SM predictions. The results are interpreted in two sets of models. In the first set, direct production of pairs of lighter top squarks (t̃_1) with long decay chains involving Z or Higgs bosons is considered. The second set includes direct pair production of the heavier top squark pairs (t̃_2) decaying via t̃_2 → Z t̃_1 or t̃_2 → h t̃_1. The results exclude at 95
Final results of the searches for neutral Higgs bosons in e^+e^- collisions at √(s) up to 209 GeV. The final results of the ALEPH search for the Standard Model Higgs boson at LEP, with data collected in the year 2000 at centre-of-mass energies up to 209,GeV, are presented. The changes with respect to the preceding publication are described and a complete study of systematic effects is reported. The findings of this final analysis confirm the preliminary results published in November 2000 shortly after the closing down of the LEP collider: a significant excess of events is observed, consistent with the production of a 115, Gcs Standard Model Higgs boson.% The final results of the searches for the neutral Higgs bosons of the MSSM are also reported, in terms of limits on mh, mA and anb.% Limits are also set on mh in the case of invisible decays.
Measurement of Higgs boson production in association with a t t pair in the diphoton decay channel using 139 fb^-1 of LHC data collected at √(s) = 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment. The measurement of Higgs boson production in association with a top quark-antiquark pair in the diphoton decay channel (H →γγ) is presented, based on the analysis of 139 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data with center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis is performed using a simultaneous fit in seven signal-enriched event categories. The tt̅H process is observed in the diphoton decay mode with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations relative to the background-only hypothesis. The expected significance is 4.2 standard deviations. The tt̅H cross-section times the H →γγ branching ratio is measured to be σ_tt̅H× B_γγ = 1.59_-0.39^+0.43 fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.
Search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons and produced in association with a W or a Z boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a W or a Z boson decaying leptonically is performed using a data sample of proton-proton collisions collected at √(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The Higgs boson is sought in its decay to a pair of τ leptons. A significance of 2.3 standard deviations is observed (1.0 expected) for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. The signal strength, μ = 2.5 ^+1.4 _-1.3, is measured relative to the expectation for the standard model Higgs boson. These results are combined with a previous analysis performed on the same data set targeting the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes with the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons. The combined results provide increased sensitivity to the Higgs boson couplings to fermions and vector bosons, which are measured to be compatible with standard model predictions within one standard deviation.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in e^+e^- Collisions at √(s) = 192-209 GeV. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson has been performed with the OPAL detector at LEP based on the full data sample collected at sqrt(s) = 192-209 GeV in 1999 and 2000, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 426 pb-1. The data are examined for their consistency with the background-only hypothesis and various Higgs boson mass hypotheses. A lower bound of 109.7 GeV is obtained on the Higgs boson mass at the 95% confidence level. At higher masses, the data are consistent with both the background and the signal-plus-background hypotheses.
Search for a pseudoscalar boson decaying into a Z boson and the 125 GeV Higgs boson in ℓ^+ ℓ^- b b̅ final states. Results are reported on a search for decays of a pseudoscalar A boson into a Z boson and a light scalar h boson, where the Z boson decays into a pair of oppositely-charged electrons or muons, and the h boson decays into b b̅. The search is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s) = 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. The h boson is assumed to be the recently discovered standard model-like Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV. With no evidence for signal, upper limits are obtained on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction of the A boson in the Zh channel. Results are also interpreted in the context of two Higgs doublet models.
Search for the bb decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson in associated W/ZH production with the ATLAS detector. A search for the bb decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson is performed with the ATLAS experiment using the full dataset recorded at the LHC in Run 1. The integrated luminosities used from pp collisions at âs = 7 and 8 TeV are 4.7 and 20.3 fbâ1, respectively. The processes considered are associated (W/Z)H production, with W â lÎ½, Z â ll (l = e, Î¼), and Z â Î½Î½. No significant excess is observed above the Standard Model (SM) backgrounds. For mH=125 GeV, a 95% CL upper limit of 1.4 times the SM expectation is set on the cross section times branching ratio for pp â (W/Z)(H â bb). The corresponding limit expected in the absence of signal is 1.3. The ratio of the measured signal strength to the SM expectation is found to be Î¼ = 0.2 Â± 0.5(stat.) Â± 0.4(syst.). The analysis procedure is validated by a measurement of the yield of (W/Z)Z production, with Z â bb, from which the ratio of the observed signal strength to the SM expectation is found to be Î¼VZ =0.9Â±0.2.
Search for the Standard Model Higgs Boson in e^+ e^- Collisions at √(s) = 161-172 GeV. This paper describes a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson using data from e^+e^- collisions collected at center-of-mass energies of 161, 170 and 172 GeV by the OPAL detector at LEP. The data collected at these energies correspond to integrated luminosities of 10.0, 1.0 and 9.4 pb^-1, respectively. The search is sensitive to the main final states from the process in which the Higgs boson is produced in association with a fermion anti-fermion pair, namely four jets, two jets with missing energy, and two jets produced together with a pair of electron, muon or tau leptons. One candidate event is observed, in agreement with the Standard Model background expectation. In combination with previous OPAL searches at center-of-mass energies close to the Z^0 resonance and the revised previous OPAL searches at 161 GeV, we derive a lower limit of 69.4 GeV for the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson at the 95% confidence level.
Search for the Higgs boson decaying to invisible particles produced in association with Z bosons decaying to bottom quarks. A search for a Higgs boson (H) decaying to invisible particles, when produced in association with a Z boson decaying to bottom quarks is reported. The search is performed in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 fb^-1 at √(s)=8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012. An upper limit at the 95limit of 1.99) is placed on the ratio of the product of the ZH production cross section times the Higgs invisible branching fraction, with respect to the expected ZH production cross section of a standard model Higgs boson.
Search for associated production of a Higgs boson and a single top quark in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search is presented for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top quark, based on data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1 . The production cross section for this process is highly sensitive to the absolute values of the top quark Yukawa coupling, y_t, the Higgs boson coupling to vector bosons, g_HVV, and, uniquely, to their relative sign. Analyses using multilepton signatures, targeting H→WW, H→ττ, and H→ZZ decay modes, and signatures with a single lepton and a bb̅ pair, targeting the H→bb̅ decay, are combined with a reinterpretation of a measurement in the H→γγ channel to constrain y_t. For a standard model-like value of g_HVV, the data favor positive values of y_t and exclude values of y_t below about -0.9 y_t ^SM.
Search for a low-mass dilepton resonance in Higgs boson decays to four-lepton final states at √(s)=13 TeV. A generic search for a low mass dilepton resonance in Higgs boson decays is conducted in the four-lepton final state. The decay is assumed to proceed via two new particles (beyond the standard model), or one new particle in association with a Z boson. The search uses proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1, at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV. No significant deviation from the standard model expectation is observed. Upper limits at 95
Measurements of the Total and Differential Higgs Boson Production Cross Sections Combining the H →γγ and H → ZZ ^*→ 4ℓ Decay Channels at √(s)=8 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. Measurements of the total and differential cross sections of Higgs boson production are performed using 20.3 fb^-1 of pp collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider at a center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 8 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector. Cross sections are obtained from measured H →γγ and H → ZZ ^*→ 4ℓ event yields, which are combined accounting for detector efficiencies, fiducial acceptances and branching fractions. Differential cross sections are reported as a function of Higgs boson transverse momentum, Higgs boson rapidity, number of jets in the event, and transverse momentum of the leading jet. The total production cross section is determined to be σ_pp → H = 33.0 ± 5.3 ( stat) ± 1.6 ( sys) pb. The measurements are compared to state-of-the-art predictions.

Measurement of exclusive γγ→ W^+W^- production and search for exclusive Higgs boson production in pp collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV using the ATLAS detector. Searches for exclusively produced W boson pairs in the process pp(γγ) → pW^+W^-p and exclusively produced Higgs boson in the process pp(gg) → pHp have been performed using e^±μ^∓ final states. These measurements use 20.2 fb^-1 of pp collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=8 TeV at the LHC. Exclusive production of W^+W^- consistent with the Standard Model prediction is found with 3.0σ significance. The exclusive W^+W^- production cross-section is determined to be σ (γγ→ W^+W^-→ e^±μ^∓ X) = 6.9 ± 2.2 (stat.) ± 1.4 (sys.) fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction. Limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings are set at 95

Search for a Higgs Boson Decaying into Two Photons at LEP. A Higgs particle produced in association with a Z boson and decaying into two photons is searched for in the data collected by the L3 experiment at LEP. All possible decay modes of the Z boson are investigated. No signal is observed in 447.5 pb^-1 of data recorded at centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV.

Search for Dark Matter Produced in Association with a Higgs Boson Decaying to bb̅ using 36 fb^-1 of pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV with the ATLAS Detector. Several extensions of the standard model predict associated production of dark-matter particles with a Higgs boson. Such processes are searched for in final states with missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying to a bbÂ¯ pair with the ATLAS detector using 36.1ââfb-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13Â TeV at the LHC. The observed data are in agreement with the standard model predictions and limits are placed on the associated production of dark-matter particles and a Higgs boson.
Measurement of the Higgs boson coupling properties in the H→ ZZ^*→ 4ℓ decay channel at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The coupling properties of the Higgs boson are studied in the four-lepton decay channel using 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collision data from the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector. Cross sections are measured for the four key production modes in several exclusive regions of the phase space and are interpreted in terms of coupling modifiers. The inclusive cross section in the H → ZZ^* decay and for a Higgs boson absolute rapidity below 2.5 is measured to be 1.73^+0.24_-0.23(stat.)^+0.10_-0.08(exp.)± 0.04(th.) pb compared to the Standard Model prediction of 1.34±0.06 pb. In addition, the tensor structure of the Higgs boson couplings is studied using an effective Lagrangian approach for the description of interactions beyond the Standard Model. Improved constraints are placed on the non-Standard-Model CP-even and CP-odd couplings to Z bosons and on the CP-odd coupling to gluons.
Update of the Background Studies in the Search for the Higgs Boson in the Two Photons Channel in pp Collisions at âs=7 TeV. This note presents an update of the study of the backgrounds to the search for the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of photons. The analysis is done with 99 pb-1 of pp collision data collected in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The measured background and its composition are in good agreement with the Standard Model predictions both in terms of overall yield and invariant mass distribution. No excess is observed.
Properties of the Higgs-like boson in the decay H to ZZ to 4l in pp collisions at sqrt s =7 and 8 TeV. The properties of the new boson with the mass around 125 GeV are reported. The boson is observed in the search for the standard model Higgs boson in the mass range 110 < m_H < 1000 GeV in the H → ZZ decay channel. The search considers final states where both Z's decay to electron, muon, or tau lepton pairs. The analysis uses pp collision data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb^-1 at √(s) = 7 TeV and 19.6 fb^-1 at √(s)= 8 TeV. It makes use of the measured four-lepton mass, the mass uncertainty, kinematic discriminants, and information sensitive to the production mechanism, such as associated dijet characteristics and transverse momentum of the four-lepton system. The boson is observed in channels with electron and muon pairs with a local significance above the expected background of 6.7 standard deviations with the mass 125.8 ± 0.5 (stat.) ± 0.2 (syst.) GeV. The signal strength μ, relative to the expectation for the standard model Higgs boson, is measured to be μ = 0.91^+ 0.30_-0.24. The signal strength modifiers associated with vector bosons and fermions in production are measured to be μ_V = 1.0^+2.4_-2.3 and μ_F = 0.9^+0.5_-0.4, thus consistent with the standard model expectations. The spin-parity of the boson is studied and the pure scalar hypothesis is found to be consistent with the observation when compared to six other spin-parity hypotheses. The data disfavour the pure pseudoscalar hypothesis 0^- with a CL_s value of 0.16
Search for fermiophobic Higgs bosons in final states with photons at LEP 2. Higgs boson production with subsequent decay to photons was searched for in the data collected by the DELPHI detector at centre-of-mass energies between 183 GeV and 209 GeV, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of nearly 650 pb^-1. No evidence for a signal was found, and limits were set on h0Z0 and h0A0 production with h0 decay to photons. These results were used to exclude regions in the parameter space of fermiophobic scenarios of Two Higgs Doublet Models.
Search for invisible Higgs bosons in pp→ZH→ 2ℓ + E_T^miss channels at √(s) = 13 TeV. A direct search is presented for a scalar boson produced in association with a Z boson and decaying to invisible particles. The scalar boson in the reference signal is assumed to be a standard-model-like Higgs boson for the production rate with 100
Measurement of the inclusive and differential Higgs boson production cross sections in the leptonic WW decay mode at √(s) = 13 TeV. Measurement of the fiducial inclusive and differential production cross sections of the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV are performed using events where the Higgs boson decays into a pair of W bosons that subsequently decay into a final state with an electron, a muon, and a pair of neutrinos. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC during 2016-2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. Production cross sections are measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson and the associated jet multiplicity. The Higgs boson signal is extracted and simultaneously unfolded to correct for selection efficiency and resolution effects using maximum-likelihood fits to the observed distributions in data. The integrated fiducial cross section is measured to be 86.5 ± 9.5 fb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation of 82.5 ± 4.2 fb. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectations is observed in the differential measurements.
Search for Displaced Muon Jets from light Higgs boson decay in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 Tev with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for collimated muon pairs produced in the decay of long-lived neutral particles in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV center of mass energy, with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. In a sample of 1.94 fbâ1 of collision events collected during 2011, the observed data are consistent with the Standard Model background expectations. Limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction of a Higgs boson decaying to Hidden Valley neutral long-lived particles are derived as a function of the particlesâ mean c*tau.
Search for new resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the ℓ^+ ℓ^- bb̅, ℓν bb̅, and νν̅ bb̅ channels with pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search is presented for new resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the ℓ^+ ℓ^- bb̅, ℓν bb̅, and νν̅ bb̅ channels in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using a total integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb^-1. The search is conducted by looking for a localized excess in the WH/ZH invariant or transverse mass distribution. No significant excess is observed, and the results are interpreted in terms of constraints on a simplified model based on a phenomenological Lagrangian of heavy vector triplets.
Observation of Higgs boson decay to bottom quarks. A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks is presented. Higgs bosons produced in association with a or boson are searched for in final states including 0, 1, or 2 charged leptons and two identified jets. The search is performed at the LHC in a data sample recorded by the CMS experiment in 2017 corresponding to 41.3 fb^-1 of collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. An excess of events is observed with a significance of 3.3 standard deviations, corresponding to a measured signal strength of 1.08± 0.34 times the standard model expectation. When combined with previous results using this production channel and data collected at 7, 8, and 13 TeV, the observed significance increases to 4.8 standard deviations and the measured signal strength is 1.01± 0.22. A combination of all CMS searches for →, including the four dominant production processes at the LHC, yields an observed (expected) significance of 5.6 (5.5) standard deviations and a signal strength of 1.04±0.20.
Search for the dimuon decay of the Higgs boson in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for the dimuon decay of the Higgs boson has been performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 collected with the ATLAS detector in pp collisions at √(s)=13 TeV at the LHC. No significant excess is observed above the background expectation. The observed (expected) upper limit on the cross-section times the branching ratio is 3.0 (3.1) times the Standard Model prediction at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV. When combined with the pp collisions data at √(s)=7 TeV and √(s)=8 TeV, the observed (expected) upper limit is 2.8 (2.9) times the Standard Model prediction.
Search for a charged Higgs boson decaying via H+ to tau(lep)+nu in ttbar events with one or two light leptons in the final state using 1.03/fb of pp collision data recorded at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector. This paper presents the results of a search for charged Higgs bosons by the ATLAS experiment, based on 1.03/fb of proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV using the single-lepton and dilepton channels in ttbar decays with a leptonically decaying tau in the final state. The data agree with the Standard Model expectation. Assuming B(H+ to tau+nu)=1, this leads to upper limits on the branching fraction B(t to bH+) between 5.2% and 14.1% for H+ masses in the range 90 GeV < m(H+) <160 GeV. In the context of the mh_max scenario of the MSSM, values of tan(beta) larger than 30-56 are excluded for H+ masses in the range 90 GeV < m(H+) < 140 GeV.
Search for lepton flavour violating decays of neutral heavy Higgs boson to μτ and eτ in proton-proton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for lepton flavor violating decays of a neutral heavy Higgs boson in the μτ and eτ decay modes is presented. The search is based on a dataset of 35.9 fb^-1 proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector in 2016, at a center-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV. The tau leptons are reconstructed in the leptonic and hadronic decay modes. No signal is observed. The observed (expected) limits on the cross section times the branching fraction of a Higgs boson of mass in the range 200-900 GeV, decaying to μτ and eτ vary from 51.9 (57.4) fb to 1.6 (2.1) fb and from 94.1 (91.6) fb to 2.3 (2.3) fb, respectively.
A combination of searches for the invisible decays of the Higgs boson using the CMS detector. Searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson using Run 1 proton-proton collision data from the CMS experiment at the LHC are combined. The searches cover a wide range of Higgs boson production modes namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion and vector boson associated production. The data samples used were collected in 2011 and 2012 and correspond to integrated luminosities of up to 4.9 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and up to 19.7 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. Data, in all channels, are consistent with the expected standard model backgrounds. Assuming standard model Higgs boson cross sections and corresponding detector acceptances, limits are set on the invisible branching fraction for each production mode separately and for the full combination of all channels. From the combination of all channels, we set an observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible branching fraction for m_H = 125 GeV to be 36
Search for nonresonant Higgs boson pair production in final states with two bottom quarks and two photons in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV. A search for nonresonant production of Higgs boson pairs via gluon-gluon and vector boson fusion processes in final states with two bottom quarks and two photons is presented. The search uses data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of √(s) = 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^-1. No significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed. An upper limit at 95% confidence level is set on the product of the Higgs boson pair production cross section and branching fraction into bb̅γγ. The observed (expected) upper limit is determined to be 0.67 (0.45) fb, which corresponds to 7.7 (5.2) times the standard model prediction. This search has the highest sensitivity to Higgs boson pair production to date. Assuming all other Higgs boson couplings are equal to their values in the standard model, the observed coupling modifiers of the trilinear Higgs boson self-coupling κ_λ and the coupling between a pair of Higgs bosons and a pair of vector bosons c_2V are constrained within the ranges -3.3 < κ_λ < 8.5 and -1.3 < c_2V < 3.5 at 95% confidence level. Constraints on κ_λ are also set by combining this analysis with a search for single Higgs bosons decaying to two photons, produced in association with top quark-antiquark pairs, and by performing a simultaneous fit of κ_λ and the top quark Yukawa coupling modifier κ_t.

Search for heavy resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the qq̅^(')bb̅ final state in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A search for heavy resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the qqÂ¯(â²)bbÂ¯ final state is described. The search uses 36.1Â fbâ1 of protonâproton collision data at s=13Â TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations, with the largest excess found at a resonance mass of 3.0 TeV with a local (global) significance of 3.3 (2.1) Ï . The results are presented in terms of constraints on a simplified model with a heavy vector triplet. Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio for resonances decaying to a W ( Z ) boson and a Higgs boson, itself decaying to bbÂ¯ , in the mass range between 1.1 and 3.8 TeV at 95% confidence level; the limits range between 83 and 1.6 fb (77 and 1.1 fb) at 95% confidence level.
MSSM Higgs production in association with b-quarks - semi leptonic. This paper presents a search of neutral Supersymmetric Higgs particles produced in association with two spectator b-quarks and decaying to pairs of b-quarks. The data used correspond to 4.8 fb^-1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during the 2011 run, at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV. The data passed a semi-leptonic trigger that required a muon in the final state. Two different data driven methods to predict the background are described, yielding low statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results are presented in the framework of MSSM, in the m_h^max scenario.
Search for single production of a heavy vector-like T quark decaying to a Higgs boson and a top quark with a lepton and jets in the final state. A search for single production of vector-like top quark partners (T) decaying into a Higgs boson and a top quark is performed using data from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb^-1. The top quark decay includes an electron or a muon while the Higgs boson decays into a pair of b quarks. No significant excess over standard model backgrounds is observed. Exclusion limits on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction are derived in the T quark mass range 700 to 1800 GeV. For a mass of 1000 GeV, values of the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction greater than 0.8 and 0.7 pb are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming left- and right-handed coupling of the T quark to standard model particles, respectively. This is the first analysis setting exclusion limits on the cross section of singly produced vector-like T quarks at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.
