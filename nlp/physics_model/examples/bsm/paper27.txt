Higgs to tau tau (MSSM) (HCP). A search for neutral Higgs bosons in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) decaying to tau pairs is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 8 TeV respectively. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 17 fb^-1, with 4.9 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and 12.1 fb^-1 at 8 TeV. To enhance the sensitivity to neutral MSSM Higgs bosons, the search includes the case where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a b-quark jet. No excess is observed in the tau-pair invariant-mass spectrum. Exclusion limits in the MSSM parameter space of M_A and tanÎ² in the m_h^ max scenario are presented.
