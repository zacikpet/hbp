"Flavour independent search for Higgs bosons decaying into hadronic final states in e+e- collisions. A search for the Higgsstrahlung process e+e- -> hZ is described, where the neutral Higgs boson h is assumed to decay into hadronic final states. In order to be sensitive to a broad range of models, the search is performed independent of the flavour content of the Higgs boson decay. The analysis is based on e+e- collision data collected by the OPAL detector at energies between 192 GeV and 209 GeV. The search does not reveal any significant excess over the Standard Model background prediction. Results are combined with previous searches at energies around 91 GeV and at 189 GeV. A limit is set on the product of the cross-section and the hadronic branching ration of the Higgs boson, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. Assuming the hZ coupling predicted by the Standard Model, and a Higgs boson decaying only into hadronic final states, a lower bound of 104 GeV/c2 is set on the mass at the 95% confidence level.

"Search for the flavor-changing interactions of the top quark with the Higgs boson in H → bb̅ channel at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) in associated production of a top quark with a Higgs boson is presented.

This is the first analysis to probe top-Higgs FCNC couplings in the single top production mode. A final state with one isolated lepton and at least three reconstructed jets, among which at least two are identified as b quark jets, is studied.

"Search for single production of a vector-like B quark decaying into a bottom quark and a Higgs boson which decays into a pair of photons. A search is presented for single production of a vector-like B quark that decays into a Higgs boson and a b quark.

Searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are presented based on the electroweak pair production of neutralinos and charginos, leading to decay channels with Higgs, Z, and W bosons and undetected lightest SUSY particles (LSPs). The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC.

A second aspect is chargino-neutralino pair production, leading to hW states with E_ T^ miss. The decays of a Higgs boson to a bottom-quark pair, to a photon pair, and to final states with leptons are considered in conjunction with hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the Z and W bosons.

"Search for doubly charged Higgs boson production in multi-lepton final states with the ATLAS detector using protonâproton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for doubly charged Higgs bosons with pairs of prompt, isolated, highly energetic leptons with the same electric charge is presented. The search uses a protonâproton collision data sample at a centre-of-mass energy of 13Â TeV corresponding to 36.1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This analysis focuses on the decays H^±±→ e^±e^± , H^±±→ e^±μ ^± and H^±±→μ ^±μ ^± , fitting the dilepton mass spectra in several exclusive signal regions. No significant evidence of a signal is observed and corresponding limits on the production cross-section and consequently a lower limit on m(H^±±) are derived at 95% confidence level. With ℓ ^±ℓ ^±=e^±e^±/μ ^±μ ^±/e^±μ ^± , the observed lower limit on the mass of a doubly charged Higgs boson only coupling to left-handed leptons varies from 770 to 870Â GeV (850Â GeV expected) for B(H^±±→ℓ ^±ℓ ^±)=100

A search is performed for Higgs bosons decaying into invisible final states, produced in association with a Zo boson in e+e- collisions at energies between 183 and 209 GeV. The search is based on data samples collected by the OPAL detector at LEP corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 660 pb-1. The analysis aims to select events containing the hadronic decay products of the Zo boson and large missing momentum, as expected from Higgs boson decay into a pair of stable weakly interacting neutral particles, such as the lightest neutralino in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The same analysis is applied to a search for nearly invisible Higgs boson cascade decays into stable weakly interacting neutral particles. No excess over the expected background from Standard Model processes is observed. Limits on the production of invisibly decaying Higgs bosons produced in association with a Zo boson are derived.

"Higgs boson searches in CP-conserving and CP-violating MSSM scenarios with the DELPHI detector. This paper presents the final interpretation of the results from DELPHI on the searches for Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). A few representative scenarios are considered, that include CP conservation and explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector. The experimental results encompass the searches for neutral Higgs bosons at LEP1 and LEP2 in final states as expected in the MSSM, as well as LEP2 searches for charged Higgs bosons and for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into hadrons independent of the quark flavour. The data reveal no significant excess with respect to background expectations. The results are translated into excluded regions of the parameter space in the various scenarios. In the CP-conserving case, these lead to limits on the masses of the lightest scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons, h and A, and on tan(beta). The dependence of these limits on the top quark mass is discussed. Allowing for CP violation reduces the experimental sensitivity to Higgs bosons. It is shown that this effect depends strongly on the values of the parameters responsible for CP violation in the Higgs sector.

A specic benchmark model is considered where all the fermion couplings to the Higgs boson are set to zero and the bosonic couplings are kept at the Standard Model values. The largest excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is found at 125.5 GeV, with a significance of 1.6 (3.0) standard deviations when taking (not taking) the look elsewhere effect into account. The data exclude this benchmark model in the ranges 110.0 - 118.0 GeV and 119.5 - 121.0 GeV at 95% confidence level. The expected exclusion limits are in the range 110.0 - 123.5 GeV at 95% confidence level.

The search is sensitive to Higgs bosons produced through the gluon fusion process and in association with a bb quark pair. No statistically significant excess is observed in the μ^+μ^- mass spectrum.

"Search for a Higgs boson decaying to four photons through light CP-odd scalar coupling using of 7 TeV pp collision data taken with ATLAS detector at the LHC. In some extensions of the Standard Model, such as MCHM or NMSSM, the Higgs boson can couple to light CP-odd scalar particles. This document presents a study of a possible contribution to a Higgs boson signal in the H→γγ channel due to H→ a a decays, where a is a light CP-odd scalar particle that decays predominantly into two photons before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter. Although this process yields four photon final states, we show that for a in the mass range of 100-400 MeV, the two photons from each a decay are often collimated so that they may be identified as a single photon. A large fraction of these events would contribute to an effective H→γγ signal. By following a selection similar to that of the H→γγ analysis, we set experimental limits for a generic class of Standard Model extensions having Higgs boson couplings to light scalar particles, assuming the a decays before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter.
