    <subfield code="a">A search for a heavy neutral Higgs boson, $A$, decaying into a $Z$ boson and another heavy Higgs boson, $H$, is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$ from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The search considers the $Z$ boson decaying into electrons or muons and the $H$ boson into a pair of $b$-quarks or $W$ bosons. The mass range considered  is 230-800 GeV for the $A$ boson and  130-700 GeV for the $H$ boson. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model, and therefore 95 % confidence-level upper limits for $\sigma\times B(A\to ZH)\times B(H\to bb \; \textrm{or} \; H \to WW)$ are set. The upper limits are in the range 0.0062-0.380 pb for the $H\to bb$ channel and in the range 0.023- 8.9 pb for the $H\to WW$ channel. An interpretation of the results in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models is also given.</subfield>
