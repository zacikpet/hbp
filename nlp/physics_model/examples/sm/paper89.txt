Study of the Higgs boson decaying to WW^* produced in association with a weak boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The search for Higgs boson production in association with a W or a Z boson, in the decay channel H → WW^*, is performed with a data sample collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies √(s)=7 TeV and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 4.5 fb^-1 and 20.3 fb^-1, respectively. The WH production mode is studied in three and two lepton final states, while a four lepton final state is used to search for ZH production. The observed significance is of 2.5 standard deviations while a significance of 0.9 standard deviations is expected for a Standard Model Higgs boson. The ratio of the combined WH and ZH signal yield to the Standard Model expectation, μ_ VH, is found to be μ_ VH =3.0^+1.3_-1.1 ( stat.)^+1.0_-0.7 ( sys.) for a Higgs boson mass of 125.36 GeV. The WH and ZH channels are also combined with the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes studied in the H → WW^* →ℓνℓν decay channel. The results are interpreted in terms of scaling factors of the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons (k_V) and fermions (k_F), the combined results are: |k_V| = 1.06^+0.10_-0.10, |k_F| = 0.85^+0.26_-0.20.
