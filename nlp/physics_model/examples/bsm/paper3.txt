Search for invisible Higgs produced in association with a Z boson. %% A direct search for a standard-model-like Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson and decaying to invisible particles is reported. A non-zero partial decay width to invisible particles could provide evidence for physics beyond the standard model. The search is performed in data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 fb^-1 at √(s) = 7 TeV and 19.6 fb^-1 at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. No deviation from the background expectation is observed and limits are set on the branching fraction of the standard model Higgs boson decaying to invisible particles assuming the standard model production rate. For a Higgs boson with = 125, the observed (expected) 95 %%
