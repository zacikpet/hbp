The study is performed using simulated proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, corresponding to 3 $\\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ of data. The expected performance of the upgraded CMS detector is used to model the object reconstruction efficiencies under HL-LHC conditions.

Using the HL-LHC data, the precision expected in ttH+tH, $\\mathrm{H}\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$ differential cross section measurements will constrain $\\kappa_\\lambda$ within the range $\\mathrm{-4.1}<\\kappa_\\lambda<\\mathrm{14.1}$, at the $95\\%$ confidence level, assuming all other Higgs boson couplings are fixed to standard model predictions. Moreover, it is possible to disentangle the effects of a modified Higgs boson self coupling from the presence of other anomalous couplings by using the differences in the shape of the measured spectrum. This separation is unique to differential cross section measurements. The ultimate sensitivity to the Higgs boson self coupling, achievable using differential cross section measurements, will result from a combination across Higgs boson production modes and decay channels.\n$$\\textit{This document has been revised with respect to the version dated November 19, 2018.}$$", "date": null, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": ["CMS-PAS-FTR-18-020"], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:2647986"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/FTR-18-020-pas.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_003-a.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_003-c.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_003-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_003-e.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_003-d.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_003-f.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_004-d.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_004-e.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_004-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_004-c.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_004-a.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_005-c.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_005-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_005-a.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_005-f.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_005-e.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_005-d.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_002-a.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_002-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_008.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_007.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_006.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2647986/files/Figure_001.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "2647700", "category": "cms_notes", "experiment": "cms", "type": "note", "title": "Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion at the High-Luminosity LHC", "abstract": "The search for a Higgs boson decaying to invisible particles, produced through the vector boson fusion mode in the High-Luminosity LHC proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=14~\\mathrm{TeV}$, is investigated based on simulation studies using Delphes, a fast-simulation package used to provide a parameterised response of the upgraded CMS detector.

Jet substructure and b tagging techniques are used to identify the top quark and Higgs boson jets, and to suppress the standard model backgrounds, which are found to be consistent with observations. Upper limits at 95\\%~CL are set on the product of the single T quark production cross section and the $\\mathcal{B}(\\rm{T}\\rightarrow \\rm{tH})$ that vary between $0.31-0.93$~pb for T quark masses in the range $1000-1800~{\\rm GeV}$.", "date": null, "superseded": "2239298", "supersedes": null, "report_number": ["CMS-PAS-B2G-16-005"], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:2160371"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/B2G-16-005-pas.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_003-a.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_003-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_001-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_004-d.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_004-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_004-c.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_004-a.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_005-b.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_005-a.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_002.pdf", "http://cds.cern.ch/record/2160371/files/Figure_001-a.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "2160252", "category": "cms_notes", "experiment": "cms", "type": "note", "title": "Search for a neutral MSSM Higgs boson decaying into tautau at 13 TeV", "abstract": "A search for a neutral Higgs boson decaying into two tau leptons is presented.

Our expected limit on Higgs boson production cross section\ntimes $H \\to b\\bar{b}$ branching ratio for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV/c$^2$ is\n4.6 times the standard model expectation, while the observed limit is 3.8 times the standard model expectation.", "date": null, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": ["CMS-PAS-HIG-12-025"], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:1460423"],

A lower limit of 66.7 GeV at 95% C.L. is obtained for the case where the Higgs decays into an invisible final state.", "date": {"$date": 826675200000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": ["CERN-PPE-96-095"], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:309217", "10.1016/0370-2693(96)00987-2"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/309217/files/ppe-96-095.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "246817", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "A search for the neutral Higgs boson at LEP", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 729993600000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:246817", "10.1016/0370-2693(93)91450-2"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/246817/files/ppe-93-030.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "241878", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Search for non-minimal Higgs bosons in Z0 decays", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 717120000000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:241878", "10.1007/BF01474331"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/241878/files/ppe-92-163.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "240433", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Searches for non-minimal Higgs bosons in Z$^{0}$ decays", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 714355200000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:240433", "10.1016/0370-2693(92)91548-N"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/240433/files/cer-000155965.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "234868", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Search for the neutral Higgs boson at LEP", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 700876800000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:234868", "10.1016/0370-2693(92)90047-8"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/234868/files/ppe-92-040.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "215165", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Search for the neutral Higgs boson", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 661392000000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:215165", "10.1016/0370-2693(91)91923-J"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/215165/files/CM-P00065293.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "212426", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Search for a low mass neutral Higgs boson in Z0 decay", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 653616000000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:212426", "10.1016/0370-2693(90)90581-P"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/212426/files/CM-P00065288.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "212187", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Search for the charged Higgs boson in Z0 decay", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 653270400000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:212187", "10.1016/0370-2693(90)90580-Y"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/212187/files/CM-P00065287.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "211680", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Search for the neutral Higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model from Z0 decays", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 651542400000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:211680", "10.1016/0370-2693(90)90942-Y"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/211680/files/CM-P00065284.pdf"]}, {"cds_id": "209423", "category": "l3_papers", "experiment": "l3", "type": "paper", "title": "Search for neutral Higgs boson in Z0 decay", "abstract": null, "date": {"$date": 646099200000}, "superseded": null, "supersedes": null, "report_number": [], "doi": ["oai:cds.cern.ch:209423", "10.1016/0370-2693(90)90040-D"], "files": ["http://cds.cern.ch/record/209423/files/CM-P00065279.pdf"]}]
