Measurements of the Higgs boson inclusive, differential and production cross sections in the 4ℓ decay channel at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. Inclusive, differential and production mode cross sections of the Higgs boson are measured in the H → ZZ^*→ 4ℓ decay channel. Additionally, cross sections are measured for the main production modes in several exclusive regions of the Higgs boson production phase space. The dataset used corresponds to proton-proton collision data produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector from 2015 to 2018, equivalent to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. The inclusive fiducial cross section for the process H → ZZ^*→ 4ℓ is measured to be 3.35 ± 0.32 fb, while the Standard Model prediction is 3.41 ± 0.18 fb. The cross-section times H → ZZ^* branching ratio with |y_H|< 2.5 for gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion production are measured to be 1.14 ± 0.13 pb and 0.13 ± 0.04 pb, respectively. All measurements are in agreement with the Standard Model prediction.
