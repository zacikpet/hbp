Higgs Boson Searches using the H â WW(â) â âÎ½âÎ½ Decay Mode with the ATLAS Detector at 7 TeV. Higgs boson searches using the H â WW(â) 5 â âÎ½âÎ½ (â = e, Î¼) decay mode have been performed with 35 pbâ1 of ATLAS data at 7 TeV proton-proton centre-of-mass energy. No evidence for a SM-like Higgs boson has been found. Rather, the SM Higgs exclusion limit as function of the Higgs mass has been presented in the mass range of 120-200 GeV. At 160 GeV, a Standard Model-like Higgs boson with a production rate of 1.2 times the Standard Model rate is excluded at 95% Confidence Level. The 95% Confidence Level upper limit on Ï Ã BR(H â WW(â)) is 54 pb at m_H = 120 GeV, 11 pb at m_H = 160 GeV and 71 pb at m_H = 200 GeV.
