Studies of Higgs boson production in the four-lepton final state at √(s)=13 TeV. Studies of Higgs boson production are presented using the H→ZZ→4ℓ (ℓ=e,μ) decay channel. These studies are performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.8 fb^-1 of pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2015. The observed significance for the standard model Higgs boson with m_H=125.09 GeV is 2.5σ, where the expected significance is 3.4σ. The model independent fiducial cross section is measured to be σ_fid.=2.48^+1.48_-1.14(stat. ⊕ sys.)^+0.01_-0.04(model dep.) fb. In addition, a search for an additional Higgs boson is performed for a range of masses up to 1 TeV and with various widths, and no significant excess is observed. The results of this search are interpreted in the context of the two Higgs doublet model.
