Measurement of the production cross section for a Higgs boson in association with a vector boson in the H → WW^∗→ℓνℓν channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. A measurement of the Higgs boson production cross sections via associated WH and ZH production using H → WW^∗→ℓνℓν decays, where ℓ stands for either an electron or a muon, is presented. Results for combined WH and ZH production are also presented. The analysis uses events produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The products of the H → WW^∗ branching fraction times the WH and ZH cross sections are measured to be 0.67^+0.31_-0.27(stat.)^+0.18_-0.14(syst.) pb and 0.54^+0.31_-0.24(stat.)^+0.15_-0.07(syst.) pb respectively, in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.
