Search for invisible decays of the Higgs boson produced through vector boson fusion at âˆš(s) = 13 TeV. A search for invisible decays of the Higgs boson is performed using 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The search targets the production of the Higgs boson through vector boson fusion. The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted background contributions from standard model processes. An observed (expected) upper limit of 0.28 (0.21), at 95
