Coupling properties of the new Higgs-like boson observed with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Details of the production and decay of the new particle discovered in the mass region of 126 GeV in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson at âs = 7 TeV and âs = 8 TeV are presented. The searches in the Hâ ZZ(â)â 4l, Hâ Î³Î³, Hâ WW(â)â lÎ½lÎ½, H â Ï+Ïâ and H â bb channels include several exclusive final states, which provide sensitivity to the coupling properties of the observed particle through the various production and decay modes. Several benchmarks are considered that are designed to probe different aspects of the SM Higgs boson couplings. No significant deviation from the prediction for a SM Higgs boson is found.
