Combination of standard model Higgs boson searches and measurements of the properties of the new boson with a mass near 125 GeV. Measurements of the properties of the recently discovered boson with a mass near 125 are presented. The results are based on data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and up to 19.6 fb^-1 at 8 TeV in proton proton collisions at the LHC. Five decay modes are studied: γγ, ZZ, WW, ττ, and bb. The mass of the new boson is measured to be 125.7± 0.3 (stat.) ± 0.3 (syst.) GeV. The event yields obtained by the different analyses targeting specific decay modes and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson. The best-fit signal strength for all channels combined, expressed in units of the SM Higgs boson cross section, is 0.80±0.14 at the measured mass. The consistency of the couplings of the observed boson with those predicted for the SM Higgs boson is tested in various ways, and no significant deviations are found.
