Search for doubly charged Higgs boson production in multi-lepton final states with the ATLAS detector using protonâproton collisions at √(s)=13 TeV. A search for doubly charged Higgs bosons with pairs of prompt, isolated, highly energetic leptons with the same electric charge is presented. The search uses a protonâproton collision data sample at a centre-of-mass energy of 13Â TeV corresponding to 36.1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This analysis focuses on the decays H^±±→ e^±e^± , H^±±→ e^±μ ^± and H^±±→μ ^±μ ^± , fitting the dilepton mass spectra in several exclusive signal regions. No significant evidence of a signal is observed and corresponding limits on the production cross-section and consequently a lower limit on m(H^±±) are derived at 95% confidence level. With ℓ ^±ℓ ^±=e^±e^±/μ ^±μ ^±/e^±μ ^± , the observed lower limit on the mass of a doubly charged Higgs boson only coupling to left-handed leptons varies from 770 to 870Â GeV (850Â GeV expected) for B(H^±±→ℓ ^±ℓ ^±)=100
