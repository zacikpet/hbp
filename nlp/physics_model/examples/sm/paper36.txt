Measurement of the Higgs boson mass in the H → ZZ^* → 4ℓ decay channel with √(s)=13 TeV pp collisions using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A measurement of the Higgs boson mass, m_H in the H → ZZ^* → 4ℓ decay channel is presented. The data employed were recorded by the ATLAS detector between 2015-2018 in proton-proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of √(s)=13 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb^-1. An analytic model that takes into account the invariant mass resolution of the four-lepton system on a per-event basis is employed. The measured value of m_H is 124.92±0.19(stat.)^+0.09_-0.06(syst.) GeV.
