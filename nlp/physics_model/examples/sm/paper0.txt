Combined measurements of the mass and signal strength of the Higgs-like boson with the ATLAS detector using up to 25 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data. An update is presented of the measurement of the properties of the newly discovered boson using the the full pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for the channels H→ γγ and H → ZZ^(*)→ 4l, corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 4.8 fb^-1 at √(s)=7TeV and 20.7 fb^-1 at √(s)=8TeV. The combined mass measurement derived from the H→ γγ and H → ZZ^(*)→ 4l channels is m_H=125.5 ± 0.2 (stat) ^+0.5_-0.6 (sys)GeV. The combination of all final states, including the H →τ^+τ^- and H → bb̅ channels using data corresponding to integrated luminosity of about 4.8 fb^-1 at √(s)=7TeV and 13 fb^-1 at √(s)=8TeV and the H → WW^(*)→ lν lν channel using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 13 fb^-1 at √(s)=8TeV, is reported in terms of the combined signal strength (μ) and production and decay mode specific signal strengths. The combined signal strength is determined to be μ = 1.43 ± 0.16 (stat)± 0.14 (sys) at a mass of 125.5 GeV.
