A search for the Higgsstrahlung process e+e- -> hZ is described, where the neutral Higgs boson h is assumed to decay into hadronic final states. In order to be sensitive to a broad range of models, the search is performed independent of the flavour content of the Higgs boson decay. The analysis is based on e+e- collision data collected by the OPAL detector at energies between 192 GeV and 209 GeV. The search does not reveal any significant excess over the Standard Model background prediction. Results are combined with previous searches at energies around 91 GeV and at 189 GeV. A limit is set on the product of the cross-section and the hadronic branching ration of the Higgs boson, as a function of the Higgs boson mass. Assuming the hZ coupling predicted by the Standard Model, and a Higgs boson decaying only into hadronic final states, a lower bound of 104 GeV/c2 is set on the mass at the 95% confidence level.",

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u0089fb-1. A highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs boson decaying to bb\u00c2\u00af is reconstructed as a single, large radius jet, and it is identified using jet substructure and dedicated b tagging techniques. The method is validated with Z\u00e2\u0086\u0092bb\u00c2\u00af decays. The Z\u00e2\u0086\u0092bb\u00c2\u00af process is observed for the first time in the single-jet topology with a local significance of 5.1 standard deviations (5.8 expected). For a Higgs boson mass of 125\u00c2 GeV, an excess of events above the expected background is observed (expected) with a local significance of 1.5 (0.7) standard deviations.

The Higgs boson production cross-section times the H \u2192\u2113\u2113\u03b3 branching ratio for m_\u2113\u2113 < 30 GeV is determined to be 8.7 ^+2.8_-2.7 fb.",

Measurements of the properties of the recently discovered boson with a mass near 125 are presented. The results are based on data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb^-1 at 7 TeV and up to 19.6 fb^-1 at 8 TeV in proton proton collisions at the LHC. Five decay modes are studied: \u03b3\u03b3, ZZ, WW, \u03c4\u03c4, and bb. The mass of the new boson is measured to be 125.7\u00b1 0.3 (stat.) \u00b1 0.3 (syst.) GeV. The event yields obtained by the different analyses targeting specific decay modes and production mechanisms are consistent with those expected for the standard model (SM) Higgs boson. The best-fit signal strength for all channels combined, expressed in units of the SM Higgs boson cross section, is 0.80\u00b10.14 at the measured mass. The consistency of the couplings of the observed boson with those predicted for the SM Higgs boson is tested in various ways, and no significant deviations are found.",

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 19.5 fb^-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC. The main emphasis is neutralino pair production in which each neutralino decays either to a Higgs boson (h) and an LSP or to a Z boson and an LSP, leading to hh, hZ, and ZZ states states with missing transverse energy E_ T^ miss. A second aspect is chargino-neutralino pair production, leading to hW states with E_ T^ miss. The decays of a Higgs boson to a bottom-quark pair, to a photon pair, and to final states with leptons are considered in conjunction with hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the Z and W bosons. No evidence is found for supersymmetric particles, and 95% confidence level upper limits are evaluated for the respective pair production cross sections and for neutralino and chargino mass values.",

The measured signal rate amounts to 0.72^+0.62_-0.53 times the production rate expected in the standard model, with an observed (expected) significance of 1.4\u03c3 (1.8\u03c3). An upper limit on the signal rate of 2.0 the standard model production rate is set at the 95",

A search is performed for Higgs bosons decaying into invisible final states, produced in association with a Zo boson in e+e- collisions at energies between 183 and 209 GeV. The search is based on data samples collected by the OPAL detector at LEP corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 660 pb-1. The analysis aims to select events containing the hadronic decay products of the Zo boson and large missing momentum, as expected from Higgs boson decay into a pair of stable weakly interacting neutral particles, such as the lightest neutralino in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The same analysis is applied to a search for nearly invisible Higgs boson cascade decays into stable weakly interacting neutral particles. No excess over the expected background from Standard Model processes is observed. Limits on the production of invisibly decaying Higgs bosons produced in association with a Zo boson are derived. Assuming a branching ratio BR(ho->invisible)=1, a lower limit of 108.2 GeV is placed on the Higgs boson mass at the 95% confidence level. Limits on the production of nearly invisibly decaying Higgs bosons are also obtained.",

A search for heavy resonances decaying to a W or Z boson and a Higgs boson in the qq\u0305^(')bb\u0305 final state is described. The search uses 36.1 fb^-1 of proton-proton collision data at \u221a(s) = 13 collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations, with the largest excess found at a resonance mass of 3.0 TeV with a local (global) significance of 3.3 (2.2) \u03c3. The results are presented in terms of constraints on a simplified model with a Heavy Vector Triplet. Upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching ratio for resonances decaying to a W (Z) boson and a Higgs boson in the mass range between 1.1 and 3.8 . The limits range between 83 and 1.6 fb (77 and 1.1 fb) at 95% confidence level.",

Under the above assumption, motivated by general 2HDM type II models, charged Higgs bosons are excluded up to a mass of 76.6GeV at 95% confidence level, independent of the branching ratio BR(Hpm->tnt). A scan of the 2HDM type I model parameter space is performed and limits on the Higgs-boson masses mHpm and mA are presented for different choices of tanb.",

In order to separate the signal from the larger t t\u0305+jets background, this analysis uses a matrix element method that assigns a probability density value to each reconstructed event under signal or background hypotheses.

This paper presents the final interpretation of the results from DELPHI on the searches for Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). A few representative scenarios are considered, that include CP conservation and explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector. The experimental results encompass the searches for neutral Higgs bosons at LEP1 and LEP2 in final states as expected in the MSSM, as well as LEP2 searches for charged Higgs bosons and for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into hadrons independent of the quark flavour. The data reveal no significant excess with respect to background expectations. The results are translated into excluded regions of the parameter space in the various scenarios. In the CP-conserving case, these lead to limits on the masses of the lightest scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons, h and A, and on tan(beta). The dependence of these limits on the top quark mass is discussed. Allowing for CP violation reduces the experimental sensitivity to Higgs bosons. It is shown that this effect depends strongly on the values of the parameters responsible for CP violation in the Higgs sector.",

Measurements targeting Simplified Template Cross Sections in different decay channels are reparameterized in terms of the impact of Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operators and constraints are reported on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. Measurements are furthermore interpreted in several MSSM benchmark scenarios, resulting in constraints on the MSSM parameters (m_A, tan \u00ce\u00b2) that are complementary to those obtained from direct searches for additional Higgs bosons. For all interpretations, no significant deviations from the Standard Model are observed.",

A search for resonant and non-resonant pair production of Higgs bosons in the bb\u0305\u03c4^+\u03c4^- final state is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb^-1 of pp collision data with \u221a(s)= 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. The semileptonic and fully hadronic decays of the \u03c4-lepton pair are considered. No significant excess above the expected background is observed in the data. The cross-section times branching ratio for non-resonant Higgs boson pair production is constrained to be less than 30.9 fb, 12.7 times the Standard Model expectation, at 95% confidence level. The data are also analyzed to probe resonant Higgs boson pair production, constraining a model with an extended Higgs sector based on two doublets and a Randall-Sundrum bulk graviton model. Upper limits are placed on the resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section times branching ratio, excluding resonances X in the mass range 305 GeV < m_X < 402 GeV in the simplified hMSSM minimal supersymmetric model for tan\u03b2=2 and excluding bulk Randall-Sundrum gravitons G_KK in the mass range 325 GeV < m_G_KK < 885 GeV for k/M_Pl = 1.",

In some extensions of the Standard Model, such as MCHM or NMSSM, the Higgs boson can couple to light CP-odd scalar particles. This document presents a study of a possible contribution to a Higgs boson signal in the H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 channel due to H\u2192 a a decays, where a is a light CP-odd scalar particle that decays predominantly into two photons before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter. Although this process yields four photon final states, we show that for a in the mass range of 100-400 MeV, the two photons from each a decay are often collimated so that they may be identified as a single photon. A large fraction of these events would contribute to an effective H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 signal. By following a selection similar to that of the H\u2192\u03b3\u03b3 analysis, we set experimental limits for a generic class of Standard Model extensions having Higgs boson couplings to light scalar particles, assuming the a decays before reaching the electromagnetic calorimeter.

A search for the production of a narrow-width resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons decaying into the bbZZ channel is presented. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector during 2016, in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The final states considered are the ones where one of the Z bosons decays into a pair of muons or electrons, and the other Z boson decays either to a pair of quarks or a pair of neutrinos. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are placed on the production of narrow-width spin-0 or spin-2 particles decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons, in models with and without an extended Higgs sector. For a resonance mass range between 260 and 1000 GeV, limits on the production cross section times branching fraction of a spin-0 and spin-2 resonance range from 0.1 to 5.0 pb and 0.1 to 3.6 pb, respectively. These results set limits in parameter space in bulk Randall-Sundrum radion, Kaluza-Klein excitation of the graviton, and N2HDM models. For specific choices of parameters the N2HDM can be excluded in a mass range between 360 and 620 GeV for a resonance decaying to two Higgs bosons. This is the first search for Higgs boson resonant pair production in the bbZZ channel.",

A measurement of the Higgs boson production cross sections via associated WH and ZH production using H \u2192 WW^\u2217\u2192\u2113\u03bd\u2113\u03bd decays, where \u2113 stands for either an electron or a muon, is presented. Results for combined WH and ZH production are also presented. The analysis uses events produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1 recorded at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The products of the H \u2192 WW^\u2217 branching fraction times the WH and ZH cross sections are measured to be 0.67^+0.31_-0.27(stat.)^+0.18_-0.14(syst.) pb and 0.54^+0.31_-0.24(stat.)^+0.15_-0.07(syst.) pb respectively, in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.",

A search for physics beyond the standard model in events with one or more high-momentum Higgs bosons, H, decaying to pairs of b quarks in association with missing transverse momentum is presented. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1, were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at the center-of-mass energy \u221a(s) = 13 TeV. The analysis utilizes a new b quark tagging technique based on jet substructure to identify jets from H\u2192bb\u0305. Events are categorized by the multiplicity of H-tagged jets, jet mass, and the missing transverse momentum. No significant deviation from standard model expectations is observed. In the context of supersymmetry (SUSY), limits on the cross sections of pair-produced gluinos are set, assuming that gluinos decay to quark pairs, H (or Z), and the lightest SUSY particle, LSP, through an intermediate next-to-lightest SUSY particle, NLSP.

A search for a massive resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons, one of which decays to a pair of \u03c4 leptons and the other to a pair of bottom quarks, is presented. This analysis is based on the proton-proton collisions data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at CMS in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. For a high-mass (\u2273 1 TeV) resonance, the hadronization products of the bottom quarks coming from one of the two intermediate H bosons give rise to the presence of one single \u201cmerged\u201d jet, which can be identified through a study of its substructure consistent with the presence of bottom quarks. Due to the large boost of the intermediate H boson, the two tau leptons are similarly overlapping. Advanced techniques are used for their reconstruction and identification in events where one \u03c4 decays hadronically and the other one decays into an electron or a muon. Upper limits at 95",

The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a bb\u0305 system that has a large Lorentz boost. The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction. Results are interpreted in terms of limits on parameters in the Baryonic Z' and 2HDM+a simplified models. For these models, the presented results constitute either the most stringent constraints or the first constraints obtained so far.",
