Search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel with the ATLAS detector. A search for a fermiophobic Higgs boson with diphoton events produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV is performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb-1 collected by the ATLAS experiment. A specic benchmark model is considered where all the fermion couplings to the Higgs boson are set to zero and the bosonic couplings are kept at the Standard Model values. The largest excess with respect to the background-only hypothesis is found at 125.5 GeV, with a significance of 1.6 (3.0) standard deviations when taking (not taking) the look elsewhere effect into account. The data exclude this benchmark model in the ranges 110.0 - 118.0 GeV and 119.5 - 121.0 GeV at 95% confidence level. The expected exclusion limits are in the range 110.0 - 123.5 GeV at 95% confidence level.
