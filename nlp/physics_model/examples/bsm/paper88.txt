Search for a non-standard-model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of new light bosons in four-muon final states. Results are reported from a search for non-standard-model Higgs boson decays to pairs of new light bosons, each of which decays into the μ^+ μ^- final state. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.65 of proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012. One event is observed after analysis selection requirements were applied. A model-independent upper limit on the product of the cross section times branching fraction times acceptance is derived. The results are applicable to a broad spectrum of new physics scenarios and are also compared with the predictions of two benchmark models, NMSSM and dark SUSY, as functions of a Higgs boson mass larger than 86and of a new light boson mass within the range 0.25–3.55.
