Measurement of gluon fusion and vector boson fusion Higgs boson production cross-sections in the H → WW^*→ eνμν decay channel in pp collisions at √(s) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. The Higgs boson production cross-sections in proton-proton collisions are measured in the H→ WW^∗→ eνμν decay channel. The proton-proton collision data were produced at the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb^-1. The gluon fusion and vector boson fusion cross-sections time the H→ WW^∗ branching ratio are measured to be 12.6 ^+1.3_-1.2 (stat.) ^+1.9_-1.8(sys.) pb and 0.50 ^+0.24_-0.23 (stat.) ± 0.18(sys.) pb, respectively, in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.
