Observation of an excess of events in the search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the H→ ZZ^(*)→ 4ℓ channel with the ATLAS detector.. A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the decay channel H→ ZZ^(â)→ l+lâl'+l'â, where l,l' = e,μ, using proton-proton collisions at sqrts=7 and 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector is presented. The four lepton invariant mass distribution is compared with Standard Model background expectations to derive upper limits on the cross section of a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass between 110 GeV and 600 GeV.
