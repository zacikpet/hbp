Combined Measurement of the Higgs Boson Mass in pp Collisions at √(s) = 7 and 8 TeV with the ATLAS and CMS Experiments. A measurement of the Higgs boson mass is presented based on the combined data samples of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN LHC in the H →γγ and H → ZZ→ 4ℓ decay channels. The results are obtained from a simultaneous fit to the reconstructed invariant mass peaks in the two channels and for the two experiments. The measured masses from the individual channels and the two experiments are found to be consistent among themselves. The combined measured mass of the Higgs boson is m_H = 125.09±0.21 (stat.)±0.11 (syst.) GeV.
