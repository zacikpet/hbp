Search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson to two light pseudoscalar bosons with two taus and two muons in the final state at âˆš(s) = 8 TeV. A search for the exotic decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of light pseudoscalar a bosons is performed in the final state with two muons and two taus. The motivation lies in models beyond the standard model, such as two-Higgs-doublet models extended with a complex singlet (2HDM+S). The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1, accumulated by the CMS experiment at LHC in 2012 at 8 TeV center-of-mass energy. Masses of the pseudoscalar boson between 20 and 62.5 GeV are probed, and upper limits between 4 and 15
