Search for associated production of dark matter with a Higgs boson that decays to a pair of bottom quarks. A search for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson that decays into a pair of bottom quarks is performed in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy √(s)=13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb^-1. The signal is characterized by a large missing transverse momentum recoiling against a bb̅ system that has a large Lorentz boost. The number of events observed in the data is consistent with the standard model background prediction. Results are interpreted in terms of limits on parameters in the Baryonic Z' and 2HDM+a simplified models. For these models, the presented results constitute either the most stringent constraints or the first constraints obtained so far.
