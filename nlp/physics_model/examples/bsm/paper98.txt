Search for resonant pair production of Higgs bosons decaying to bb̅ and τ^+τ^- in proton-proton collisions at √(s) = 8 TeV. A search for a massive resonance decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons, one of which decays to a pair of τ leptons and the other to a pair of bottom quarks, is presented. This analysis is based on the proton-proton collisions data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at CMS in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb^-1. For a high-mass (≳ 1 TeV) resonance, the hadronization products of the bottom quarks coming from one of the two intermediate H bosons give rise to the presence of one single “merged” jet, which can be identified through a study of its substructure consistent with the presence of bottom quarks. Due to the large boost of the intermediate H boson, the two tau leptons are similarly overlapping. Advanced techniques are used for their reconstruction and identification in events where one τ decays hadronically and the other one decays into an electron or a muon. Upper limits at 95
